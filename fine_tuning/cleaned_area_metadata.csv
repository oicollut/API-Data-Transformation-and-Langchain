02136db0-b071-41c9-94aa-a05d115403fe;description;"Grand Teton National Park is located in northwestern Wyoming and welcomes everyone to take in the grandeur of the 40-mile-long Teton Range - rising more than 7,000 ft above the valley of Jackson Hole. The elevation starts at 6,320-feet in a sagebrush-dominated valley floor and goes up to 13,770 ft at the Grand Teton summit. Crystal alpine lakes that mirror high peaks, bright meadows, full of wildflowers, and garrulous streams that fall down rocky canyons make this park an ideal place for a visit.;The park got its name after Grand Teton, the tallest mountain of the Teton Range. It comes from ‘les trois tétons’ - ‘the three teats’ - given by early 19th-century French-speaking trappers, that was later shortened to Tetons. The range is not the only point of interest - mesmerizing 15-mile-long Jackson Lake also lies in one of the park’s valleys.Grand Teton National Park offers dozens of recreational opportunities, including mountaineering, backpacking, fishing, and many more. Hiking is extremely popular in the park, with more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over 200 miles of hiking trails."
02136db0-b071-41c9-94aa-a05d115403fe;geologyAndHistory;"The Teton Range landscape wasn't created overnight - it took the planet billions of years. Natural forces such as earthquakes, glaciers, and erosion have shaped this magnificent territory. Some of the oldest rocks in North America are present in the park - gneiss, a 2.7 billion-year-old metamorphic rock, makes up much of the Teton Range. It was formed when two tectonic plates collided - then seafloor sediments and volcanic debris buried it up to 18 miles deep. A similar collision of plates created the Himalayas!; The intense heat and pressure changed these sediments and separated different minerals - nowadays, you can see that in the rock’s zebra-striped layers. After that, molten magma squeezed into cracks, cooled, and crystallized into igneous granite.;This range itself is one of the youngest in North America, uplifting for less than 10 million years.; In comparison, the Rockies are 50-80 million years old, and the Appalachians are older than 300 million years. Erosion hasn’t influenced these mountains much, so their jagged peaks are still tall.;The Teton fault is still active, and 7.0-7.5 magnitude earthquakes can occur from time to time.;More recently it was the glaciers' turn - during Pleistocene Ice Age, they sculpted the landscape, widening V-shaped river canyons into U-shaped glacial canyons and forming cavities for future lakes.;About 200,000 years ago, the glaciers flowed and left behind outwash plains of gravel and cobbles - now the plains are covered by sagebrush, and conifer trees cover former glaciers' borders. Before receding, glaciers carried cobbles, boulders, and gravel, that presently form moraines and mark the glaciers' terminuses.;These lands saw the first people 11,000 years ago, when the first nomadic Indigenous Tribes came for hunting and gathering during warm months. They entered the Jackson Hole valley and left behind stone tools, tipi rings, and fire pits. In summer, the tribes came to harvest berries and bulbs, fish the streams and lakes, and hunt wildlife. As it got colder, they migrated to warmer areas.The first European explorers came here in the early 19th century. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted major fur-trading companies. Eventually, in the 1880’s, the area was settled by homesteaders and ranchers.; Though they struggled to farm and raise cattle due to the rocky and sandy soil - many of them turned to tourism and ‘dude ranches,’ and found the success that led to the area’s further development.It took a long time of fighting for this territory’s protection to gain the National Park status. It all began in the late 19th century and continued for decades - with the eventual involvement and lobbying of John D. Rockefeller - Grand Teton National Park was finally established in 1929.; Rockefeller actually went on to donate all of the land (35,000+ acres) he purchased in the area to expand the park in 1950."
02136db0-b071-41c9-94aa-a05d115403fe;wildlifeInfo;"Grand Teton National Park’s ecosystem is almost pristine, so visitors have the chances to find flora and fauna that have existed here since prehistoric times. More than 1,000 species of plants, dozens of mammal and fish species, 300 species of birds, and a few species of reptiles and amphibians consider this park their home. There are four major zones within the park: alpine, forest, sagebrush flats, and wetlands.;Mammals that roam this park include moose, elk, mule deer, grizzly and black bears, bison, pronghorn, wolves, and mountain lions. On the valley floor, uinta ground squirrels, red squirrels, and least chipmunks are pretty common, while badgers, long-tailed weasels, pine martens, and wolverines exist but are rarely encountered. Pikas, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and yellow-bellied marmots inhabit rocky areas of the park, so be on the lookout for them. River otter, muskrat, and beaver can be spotted in the park’s waters.;Not far from them, you can see six species of amphibians that live in Grand Teton: boreal chorus frogs, boreal toads, spotted frogs, tiger salamanders, northern leopard frogs, and bullfrogs. Watch out - there are three species of snakes (wandering garter, valley garter, and rubber boa) that typically live near water. Fortunately, there are no venomous snakes in the park.;If you are lucky enough, you might see the calliope hummingbird - the smallest North American bird that weighs less than a tenth of an ounce (be on the lookout when you pass willow shrubs and blooming scarlet gilia). The largest waterfowl, the trumpeter swan, can be found in the park, too - at Swan Lake, Oxbow Bend, and Flat Creek. Osprey and bald eagles hunt and nest near water here, too.;The variety of vegetation astounds, too, and includes lodgepole, whitebark, and limber pines; Engelmann and blue spruce; and Douglas and subalpine fir. Under these trees, there are many lichens, mosses, and liverworts. In spring, various wildflowers tint the park’s lands - silvery lupine, scarlet gilia, low larkspur, moss campion, alpine forget-me-not, and sky pilot. Antelope bitterbrush, low sagebrush, and rabbitbrush are the common shrubs growing in the park."
04adde50-cd2e-4ae6-9d5f-6a7f8e8903ad;description;The Russian Wilderness in Northern California sprawls about 12,000 acres within the Klamath National Forest. This obscure and underappreciated wilderness provides a well-developed trail system over an almost untouched landscape. Alongside the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the south and the Marble Mountain Wilderness to the north, the Russian Wilderness is part of an extensive, seemingly roadless complex, which serves as a major natural habitat in the state. Due to its remote location, the area is a heaven for those looking to immerse themselves in a secluded adventure through gorgeous alpine lakes, U-shaped glacial valleys, and botanical wonders. The Russian Wilderness is relatively small in size, so visitors can reach many of the major highlights in just about two hours of hiking or horseback riding, which gives plenty of time to soak them all in. The high density of lakes is yet another of the Russian Wilderness's notable features. Over 40 lakes and ponds are strewn through the area, the largest being Big Duck Lake, Big Blue Lake, and Paynes Lake - the swimming here is excellent, and the lakes, coupled with plentiful trout, make for great fishing spots. 
04adde50-cd2e-4ae6-9d5f-6a7f8e8903ad;wildlifeInfo;"The Russian Wilderness with the surrounding Klamath Mountains is considered an important refuge for flora and fauna in California and is noted for its biodiversity. Seventeen conifer species co-exist here in one square mile, which is likely more than anywhere else on the planet. Large stands of rare-for-California subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce cover the wilderness landscape, along with foxtail pine, whitebark pine, Jeffrey pine, Shasta fir, and Pacific yew, to name a few.;As for wildlife, the wilderness supports a great diversity of mammals, including black-tailed deer, fishers, martens, beavers, coyotes, and even wolverines. Black bears and mountain lions also roam the area. The wilderness is a great option for birdwatching, too, with California quail, northern pileated woodpecker, Townsend’s Solitaire, and Hermit Warbler nesting here. Local lakes and streams hold stocks of brown trout, eastern brook trout, and rainbow trout."
04adde50-cd2e-4ae6-9d5f-6a7f8e8903ad;geologyAndHistory;"What is now called the Russian Wilderness was populated by multiple Indigenous Tribes, including the Karuk, the Tolowa Dee-ni’, the Yurok, the Shasta, the Konomihu, and the Hoopa, for thousands of years. In contrast with the major part of coastal California, this region was rougher and less visited by the early European immigrants. During the mid-1800’s, fur trappers and hunters went on expeditions through the area after the Hudson’s Bay Company set up a central trading station in Portland, Oregon, in the middle of the 1820’s. After a gold discovery in the Russian Wilderness, near the city of Yreka in the 1850’s, present-day Siskiyou County received a large influx of prospectors and miners.;;The federal government initially put the region under their management in 1905, but only in 1984 did the Russian Wilderness gain official protection as a natural, roadless area.;When it comes to geology, the Russian Wilderness peaks belong to the Klamath Mountains, a remote range in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon. In particular, they are part of one of the Klamath subranges, the Salmon Mountains. Along with other subranges - the Marble Mountains, Eddy Range, Castle, and the largest one, the Siskiyou Mountains, they are part of a continuing system of mountain ranges that stretch through the western edge of North America and includes the California Ranges, the Canadian Coast Mountains, and others. Together with adjacent Trinity Alps and Marble Wildernesses, the Russian Wilderness also forms an important continuous corridor for California wildlife, e.g. migrating herds of black-tailed deer.;The Russian Wilderness is primarily underlain by glacier-carved granite crags formed during the Mesozoic Era, and as a result, the geology is similar to that of the Sierra Nevada."

If this is actually the correct translation, it would make sense as the forest is noted for countless bodies of water, including some of Oregon's most beautiful waterfalls. 272-foot Watson Falls, the third-highest in the state, and the less gigantic, yet equally stunning, Susan Creek Falls and Lemolo Falls are just a few of the others that boast epic displays. Turquoise lakes and alluring ponds abound in the forest as well.Other features of the area include a massive old-growth forest, that occupies over half a million acres, and exceptional geological, and often self-descriptive, formations such as Eagle and Rattlesnake Rocks.A visit to the forest is an excellent opportunity to dive into nature as it receives fewer visitors compared to the areas nearby.;There is a vast variety of recreation activities available, with something to engage in year-round. Forest guests can enjoy hundreds of miles of trails or take a drive on the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway; horseback riding, rafting, rock climbing, fishing, and camping are among the other activities that tempt people into visiting."

064dd1df-3664-4378-8944-a89e0b7ae397;geologyAndHistory;"Numerous geological processes — such as massive volcanic activity, the High Cascades glaciation, and whitewater rapids — shaped the stunning terrain and landscape of the Umpqua National Forest, including the abundant waterfalls. The fact that the Umpqua National Forest unites several distinct geologic provinces resulted in such an interesting array of natural events. Andesite monolithic spires and volcanic basalt are typical of the forest and are among its most striking geologic features.;As for Forest's historical background, over 10,000 years ago, the first people to inhabit the land were the ancestors of the Umpqua, Yoncalla, Southern Molala Tribes, and Cow Creek Band. After European and American settlers moved to the area, disease and violence, including the Rogue River Wars, greatly reduced the tribes’ populations.; Eventually, they were forcibly moved to Siletz and Grand Ronde Reservations. The Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua currently remains within the upper Umpqua Basin and is working towards restoring their ancestral homeland - learn more about the band on their website.;In 1925, the United States Congress signed into law a bill that designated the Umpqua National Forest. At that time, logging and mining activities had been taking place before the area was protected and the Civilian Conservation Corps started to build bridges, roads, and recreation facilities."

Vegetation zones starting in the foothills with oak woodlands and chaparral are followed by pine forests which eventually turn into alpine meadows as you move higher in the mountains. Pines of the montane and subalpine zones are represented by white fir, sugar, incense-cedar, red fir, ponderosa, whitebark, foxtail, and limber pines. Outstanding members of this community, giant sequoias win in terms of size but are outnumbered by the pine trees.;Wildlife is distributed in a similar way, according to the zones. Typical mammals in the foothills are gray fox, bobcat, striped and spotted skunks, black bear, woodrat, pocket gopher, and white-footed mouse; with plenty of birds and reptiles as well: California quail, scrub jay, lesser goldfinch, wrentit, acorn woodpecker, gopher snake, California kingsnake, striped racer, western whiptail lizard, and the California newt.;Chickaree, gray and golden-mantled ground squirrels, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, and a variety of birds populate the montane forests and meadows.

0a5762d9-5874-4f31-be67-7eb0bdfa6bed;geologyAndHistory;"The topography of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks encompasses portions of two grand geological formations: the foothills of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada range.;The terrain was shaped by Pleistocene glaciers and subduction along the North American–Pacific Plate boundary that created peaks, canyons, domes, glacial lakes, and marble caves.High peaks in the east of the parks (from 12,000 to 14,000 feet) descend steeply to the elevations of 4,500 feet in the western part, thus creating an impressive contrast. Mount Whitney is probably the most famous peak in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon’s collection and one of the tallest mountains in the US, at 14,500 feet of elevation.;Mountains and canyons are mostly composed of granite, diorite, and monzonite which are 100 million years old igneous intrusive rocks. Yet, the Sierra Nevada Range is only 10 million years old and was formed when the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block tilted and uplifted under the influence of tectonic forces in the region of the Great Basin.;The impact of the glaciers is evident through the U-shaped valleys of Cedar Grove, Paradise Valley, and Tehipite Valley. Tehipite Dome, the biggest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, was also formed by glaciers. Although nothing is left of those ancient glaciers these days, it doesn’t mean there are no glaciers in the parks: they are found on the highest peaks and they are surprisingly rather young (~1,000 years old). However, they are melting swiftly and it is very likely they will soon disappear because of rising temperatures.;;HistoryThe area of the parks was originally populated by the Monache. They primarily occupied the vicinity of the Kaweah River (i.e., the Foothills region) but they also used the mountain passes as trade routes. European settlers brought with them diseases new to the Indigenous Peoples and as the result, their population shrank substantially in a short period of time. Another problem the Monache had to face was the loss of their lands as the settlers began actively using the natural resources of the area, the Giant Sequoia trees being one of them.;In 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established in an attempt to preserve the land and protect the trees from logging. Kings Canyon National Park was designated in 1940 largely because of (and thanks to!) John Muir’s activism. The two parks united in 1943 due to their closeness and similarities."

0b3cb362-7c5d-485f-9e4a-b11f7280daa6;geologyAndHistory;"HistoryThe earliest residents of the land in and around what later became the Hoover Wilderness were the Ahwahnechee, who lived there for at least the last 8,000 years. The Sierra Miwok were also known to visit the area as part of their trading routes. In the late 1840’s and 1850’s, during the California Gold Rush, the large influx of Europeans resulted in the Indigenous Peoples being forced from their traditional dwellings.;Almost one hundred years later, the Hoover Wilderness became officially protected as it acquired the status of ‘Primitive Area’ in 1931 and got its name from then-president - Herbert Hoover. In 1956 the area was designated a Wilderness Area and became federally protected. The territory of the Hoover Wilderness was enlarged significantly to its present size in 2009.GeologyThe Hoover Wilderness occupies a portion of the Sierra Nevada mountain range stretching from the Sonora Pass on the north to the Tioga Pass on the south.;The beginning of the Sierra Nevada geological history is associated with the Triassic period and the formation of the region’s earliest granite. During the ‘Nevadan Orogeny’ metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic rounded domes were created and U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake that took place in 1872.;If you are interested in the geology of the Hoover Wilderness you can also check this geologic map by the U.S. Geological Survey."

NPCNF is the combination of two national forests (Nez Perce National Forest and Clearwater National Forest) which were administratively combined in 2012. The forest consists of six ranger districts, each offering their own unique outdoor recreation and camping opportunities. NPCNF owes its diverse range of activities to its geography, biodiversity, rich history, and climate.;Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest has a humid continental climate with warm summers. This climate makes hiking, camping and boating here especially enjoyable, as visitors will likely avoid extreme temperatures during the summer months. During the winter, however, there is plenty of snow and the temperatures remain below freezing, but this creates opportunities for winter recreation like snowmobiling and cross-country skiing.This climate also gives way to a wonderful diversity of plants and animals in the forest. In fact, these two and a half million acres of mountains and vast landscapes are also home to the southern end of the largest inland temperate rainforest in North America!; Fir and Pine species generally dominate this forest though so do thousands of streams and multiple major rivers, making it one of the best places for rafting and fishing in the United States.; Aside from its vast outdoor recreation opportunities, NPCNF has preserved thousands of historical and archaeological sites - from the Nimiipuu Nation who arrived 11,500 years ago to the arrival of European-Americans in the 1800’s."

0bc37aba-37c9-420b-8186-c4212bf0a659;geologyAndHistory;"Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is rich in natural and human history in large part due to the fact that humans have inhabited the lands that today make up this forest for over 10,000 years - the people of the Nimiipuu Tribe were the main inhabitants of these lands until just over 200 years ago when Lewis &amp; Clark led an expedition across these land in 1805-1806. Today you can visit the Lewis &amp; Clark Grove on Cedar Creek, which commemorates where the expedition team set up camp.;In addition to explorers, this region became frequented by fur trappers such as John Work, who led a party of about fifty from Hudson Bay along the Lolo Trail in 1831.; The party was caught in an unusually early snowstorm in October that year which covered the grass in up to six feet of snow, made travel difficult if not impossible, and resulted in the loss of some of his horses.Later came miners with the discovery of gold in Pierce, Idaho in 1860 and most of the major streams that run through Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest owe their English names to the miners from that time who named them. Most of the miners and gold prospectors arrived from California, already experienced in the business thanks to the gold rush in the 1840s that brought them to California in the first place.The 1870s saw clashes between Americans and native peoples, namely, some tribes of the Nimiipuu People (or Nez Perce as Lewis &amp; Clark had called them).; They fought under the leadership of Chief Joseph who had resisted efforts by American settlers to relocate them from their ancestral lands in Oregon to less populated areas in Idaho. This became known as the Nez Perce War, a war that was fought for some 1,200 miles while the tribe was under pursuit of General Oliver Howard. Finally cornered in northwest Montana, not far from the Canadian border, Chief Joseph surrendered under the condition that he and his people could return to the promised reservation in Idaho.;Today the Nez Perce reservation is situated in western Idaho near the Oregon and Washington borders, and is immediately adjacent to present-day Clearwater National Forest, which was established in 1908. More than a century later in 2012, Clearwater National Forest was combined with Nez Perce National Forest, giving way to the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest we have today. Read more about the history and culture of this region from one of the Forest Service’s Historical and Cultural Publications.Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is located in the Northern Rocky Mountains Rocky Mountain System, except for a few small sections which are located in the Columbia Plateau (See Map).;As for natural history, the story of the region’s geology is just as interesting but obviously goes back much further than human history. Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest rests upon a bedrock of partially metamorphosed, Precambrian rocks that are part of the Belt Supergroup - a layer of sedimentary rocks that are over a billion years old! During the Precambrian Era, sediments were deposited into a vast, yet shallow sea which covered most of western Montana and even parts of northern Idaho. This sea is known as the Belt Basin. The sediments cemented into sandstones, shales, and limestones, which over time, and under the forces of heat and pressure, metamorphosed into quartzite, the product of metamorphosed quartz sandstone, and argillite, which is basically a lithified mud.Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is part of the Rocky Mountains, a mountain range that was uplifted and folded along fault lines. These faults have not only played a role in the landscape’s development, but have also played a role in determining the movement of water through streams and rivers here. These faults and the associated tectonic movement has significantly altered the layers of the aforementioned Belt rocks. In some areas of Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest, you can observe its highly weathered and crushed Basalt bedrock.Another final note worthy of mention is the role volcanoes have played in formation of this region’s geography and landscape. Eruptions from volcanoes in Washington and Oregon, namely, Glacier Peak, Mount St. Helens, and Crater Lake have all contributed to the mineral-rich composition of this forest’s soil, which lays atop the Basalt bedrock. These mineral deposits from volcanic eruptions have helped make this area so highly productive in terms of plant life and vegetation.

More than four million people visit annually, making it one of the most popular national monuments - though the number is not necessarily surprising given that almost 17 million people live within a ninety-minute drive. The San Gabriel Mountains NM is managed by the US Forest Service and comprises over 340,000 acres of the Angeles National Forest and 4,000 acres of the San Bernardino National Forest.The San Gabriel Mountains are particularly rugged with rolling hills, peaks, and deep canyons that make the range quite difficult to traverse. John Muir once said: “Not even in the Sierra have I ever made the acquaintance of mountains more rigidly inaccessible.” The National Monument encompasses almost all the major peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, including Mount Baden-Powell (9,399 feet), Throop Peak (9,138 feet), and Mount Baldy (10,064 feet). Gorgeous waterfalls, dense forests, and protected Wild and Scenic Rivers all contribute to the grand scenery of the mountainous region. And there are over 600 archaeological sites within the National Monument’s boundaries!Outdoor enthusiasts of all types will find something for themselves here. Bike lovers will enjoy a national bicycle trail, the 7-mile West Fork National Scenic Byway that runs parallel to the West Fork River. Those looking for an Off-Highway Vehicle experience will be entertained by the Pit, an area along the slopes of Pine Mountain, on the Rincon Shortcut Road. Hikers are welcomed on dozens of hiking trails that together cover over 500 miles of the area, including 176 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. Other recreational activities are horseback riding, fishing, hunting, hand-gliding, and picnicking.
12d52153-2b50-463e-b188-8c817bd2d85b;geologyAndHistory;"To protect “objects of historic and scientific interest”, President Barack Obama dedicated the area as the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in 2014, by use of the Antiquities Act of 1906. It is managed by the US Forest Service. For information on human history within the area, please visit the monument’s managing national forest pages: Angeles National Forest and San Bernardino National Forest.In terms of geology, the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument covers nearly the entire portion of the San Gabriel Mountains. The area mostly consists of granitic and metasedimentary rocks formed in the Precambrian and Mesozoic periods and the mountains themselves were uplifted by a set of fault blocks in the Cenozoic Era. The mountains were specifically shaped mostly by the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults.The San Gabriel Mountains are known for having the fastest erosion in the contiguous United States, especially as forest fire rates have increased over the 1900’s and into the 2000’s.; More fires mean less vegetation to keep soil in place; less soil means less vegetation regrowth.; At present, it’s very hard to predict whether the soil will be able to restore itself."

Farmers densely settled the region during the twentieth century and grazed sheep and cattle in the fragile alpine meadows. Not so many years passed until grazing eventually was banned, especially as tourism started to boom here in the 1970’s when the North Cascades Highway 20 was built. In 1968, the Pasayten Wilderness was established by Congress and added 200,000 acres to the Okanogan National Forest.Geologically, the Pasayten is part of the North Cascades which features some of the most rugged landscapes in the Cascade Range. The Cascade Mountains formation began millions of years ago in the late Eocene Epoch. When the North American Plate overrode the Pacific Plate, volcanic, igneous rock-forming events occurred. Around 50 million years ago, terranes, small pieces of the oceanic and continental lithosphere, formed, more specifically, the North Cascades. More than two million years ago, during the Pleistocene Era, repetitive advancing and retreating glacial activity washed out the region’s topography and left deposits of rock debris, as well as U-shaped valleys and the only boreal hummocks in the continental U.S. The constant glaciation, uplifts, and faults formed the summits and valleys of the region as we see them now.;"

And the first Europeans here were Spanish explorers and missionaries in the 1700s, but they had little impact on these lands. In the early 1800s,; hunters and fur trappers came to the region, and by the mid-19th century, prospectors had completely conquered these pristine lands. Just after 1860, when Samuel Bishop, with his hired men, stepped into Sierra’s eastern valley. Bishop occupied this region as if the Paiute,; who were already here, didn’t exist, and it left a significant mark. His cattle fed on the areas hyacinth and nutgrass, which the Paiute lived off. Paiute stocks were exhausted even before the devastating 1861–62 winter, which led them to starvation. The forest can tell thousands of such stories. Still to this day, terrific examples of Native American presence can be found in the Inyo, though they should never be touched.;In terms of geology, the Inyo NF primarily sprawls within the eastern Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains. Among the natural forces that shaped the area are massive sedimentation and erosion, volcanism and seismic upheaval, both gradual and violent, and the slow power of glaciation.;The Inyo National Forest was created in 1907 as the result of a proclamation by Theodore Roosevelt.

The bands included the Kalapuyans, Molalas, Chinookan Clackamas, Shinookan Wascas, Northern Paiutes, and Sahaptins.Fascinating enough, Middle and Upper Chinookan bands had a trail system, which almost runs concurrently with the modern Pacific Crest Trail.;The tribes referred to Mount Hood as a sacred place. The legend goes that the Great Spirit became angry with his sons who were fighting over a woman, and turned all three into well-known mountains: Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood. Originally Mount Hood was known as Wy'est, and the word still lives in the names of local streets, businesses, and buildings.;The first Europeans who visited the area were British officers in 1792, who were followed by Lewis and Clark in 1805-06. The Mount Hood National Forest received its first official designation in 1892. The forest has a rich history of names. For one year, it was known as Bull Run Timberland Reserve, then the Cascade Range Forest Reserve.; When the US Forest Service was formed, the area was renamed again and referred to as the Oregon National Forest. Finally, in 1924 the forest was named after its most famous mountain, as the Mount Hood National Forest. Many attempts were made to change its status to that of a National Park and forbid logging operations but without success. By the 1920’s, the forest received more and more visitors and gained more popularity.;As people living around the forest needed job opportunities, especially during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed and provided a lot of them. The newly employed would go on to help build campgrounds, trails, and the famous Timberline Lodge. The largest project by that time, the lodge was formally opened by FDR in 1937, and it was declared Oregon's tenth National Historic Landmark in 1977. For all the trivia buffs out there, it also appeared in the movie The Shining. Being constructed as a ski lodge, Timberline Lodge still retains its original purpose today.From the geologic point of view, it is Mount Hood itself, a stratovolcano, that can be considered as one of the most curious features of the forest. A part of the Cascade Range, it was formed by glacial and volcanic activities, and is currently home to eleven glaciers. It has erupted sporadically for 500,000 years, but for the last 200 years, it has been inactive except for a few minor eruptions. For more information on its geology, visit Oregon Encyclopedia."

A series of massive glacial lake outbursts, known as the Missoula Floods, cut the deep and steep walls that we see today. The last outbursts actually flooded the river up to the Crown Point, which today is 733 ft. above the river. As the erosion was swift, numerous layers of volcanic rock were exposed.;For more information on the geology of the Columbia River Gorge, check out gorgeconnection.org or The Evolving Landscape of the Columbia River Gorge.;As for the area’s human history, people have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Celilo Falls was the main fishing and trading area for local Indigenous Tribes. Also, the Columbia River Gorge was an important transportation corridor. When Europeans started to take an interest in the area and subsequently immigrate there, the Tribes suffered from new epidemics and violence. For more information on the development of the area, please visit the History &amp; Culture page of the US Forest Service.The Columbia River Gorge was the second ever area to be established as a U.S. National Scenic Area; it was designated by the US Congress and President Reagan in 1986.;Another more recent event that is worth mentioning is the Eagle Creek Fire.; The fire burned for three months in the fall of 2017 and heavily restricted access to certain portions of the NSA.

246cc9cd-3364-436a-abc9-f5ee8330e2ee;geologyAndHistory;GeologyAs the territory of the Wilderness covers a portion of the Sierra Nevada, the geology of the Desolation Wilderness is closely related to the Sierra Nevada geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today and carved the roche moutonnées, erratics, and countless basins that define the local terrain. Hundreds of lakes formed within these basins, e.g., Emerald Bay, Cascade Lake, Fallen Leaf Lake, and Echo Lakes.HistoryThe Desolation Wilderness preserves some historic artifacts proving that the Washoe used to build temporary camps in several areas here, including Wrights Lake. They stayed at those camps during their regular summer migrations to the Sierra Nevada. The rest of the year they spent time partially in the ranges to the east and partially in the valleys in-between.In the beginning of the 19th century, Europeans started to explore the area. Miners came here in search of gold but didn’t find much. Between the 1850’s and 1950’s sections of the Wilderness were used for grazing and several dams were constructed.The area has been officially protected since 1899 but acquired the Wilderness Area status and its present name only in 1969 after a series of reorganizations.

Apart from Mount Thielsen, this summit shape also unites Mount Washington with Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. This group has an informal name, 'Oregon's Matterhorns,' as a result of their similarity to the famed Swiss peak. All the volcanoes in the group stopped erupting at least 100,000 to 250,000 years ago, resulting in drastic reshaping by glaciers throughout time. Extensive glaciation during the late Pleistocene is evident in the cirques and U-shaped canyons carved into the slopes of the volcano, outwash plains, as well as lateral, recessional, and terminal ground moraines.HistoryIn 1872, a wagon road was created across McKenzie Pass. Six decades later, the road was paved and became Oregon Route 242. It owes its name to the neighboring McKenzie River. Donald McKenzie, after whom the river was named, was a fur trader who explored the region in 1812.; Today, the pass and Route 242 make up the southern border of the Mount Washington Wilderness;Another fun fact from the history of the Wilderness - the first to climb Mount Washington were six boys from the nearby town of Bend in 1923.The Mount Washington Wilderness was officially established in 1964."

Among them are the southwestern willow flycatcher, the coastal California gnatcatcher, Least Bell’s vireo, and the Laguna Mountains skipper. Due to loss of habitat to a nearby home and business development, the Cleveland National Forest has become even more important for these species’ survival.As for vegetation, chaparral predominates, in particular, chemise, manzanita, and ceanothus. Scarce riparian (streamside) areas sprawl the area as well. Meadows and sections near streams are profuse with large oaks, while higher elevations are home to Jeffrey and Coulter Pine groves."
313dcf0f-3cf0-41bd-9fe2-fcae583b7752;geologyAndHistory;"Cleveland National Forest's lands were populated by humans presumably 10,000 years ago, and before Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo of Spain's arrival in 1542, they were known only to Indigenous Tribes. The Kumeyaay, Luiseños, Cahuilla, and Cupeño Tribes securely lived off hunting and profuse acorns.;Despite Cabrillo's visit, these lands gained little attention until 1769, when the Peninsular Range and its coastal plain aroused great interest. Not to let England and Russia interfere in the territory, Spain supported Junípero Serra in conducting his first California Missions. Since that time, explorers began to have a huge impact on the pristine lands, much beyond that of the previous centuries.;In 1869, a gold Mother Lode was discovered near Julian and brought many miners to the area. At the same time, zinc, lead, and silver minings were flourishing in the Santa Anas' western canyons. Additionally, in Trabuco Canyon, one may still find remnants of a large and inefficient tin mine whose owner from the Eagle Milk Co was wanting to produce cans for his milk.Mining degraded the lands with timber cuts and brush burning for miners to enter new areas to seek out minerals.;;;Reports from the 1870's - 1880's stated fires were burning out of control at times for weeks, causing severe damage and lacking support from a forest reserve. As a result, in 1891, the Forest Reserve Act was signed. Though it was supposed to reduce destructive and unauthorized timber cutting, it had a different meaning in California: concerns about watershed protection, significantly impacted by ongoing fires, was a more important matter then. Overall, the Cleveland National Forest has a rich (and sorrowful) fire history, including the two largest wildfires in California: the Cedar Fire of 2003 and the 1889 Santiago Canyon Fire, which resulted in vast burnt sections and many animal species being threatened.Named in honor of President Cleveland, an immense 1,904,826 acre National Forest was established by President Roosevelt in 1908, which was followed by its gradual partition. At present, the Cleveland National Forest comprises 460,000 acres.As for geology, the Santa Ana, Palomar, and Laguna (Cuyamaca) Mountains rise through the forest. These three mountain ranges make up a part of the Peninsular Range, which stretches 800 miles from the Santa Ana Mountains to Baja California.;"

On December 19, 2002, 17,055 more acres containing the watersheds of Willow Creek and San Carpoforo Creek were designated as part of the wilderness as per the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act. This brought the total acreage of the wilderness up to 31,555.The first known inhabitants of Big Sur are the Ohlone, Esselen, and Salinan Tribes — nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved from coastal areas to inland forests depending on the availability of food sources. However, their populations were decimated by the advent of Spanish colonization in the late 1700s.The Spanish founded Monterey as their colony’s capital north of the land they called “El Sur Grande” — “The Big South” due to its sheer size and lack of exploration. Big Sur became a part of Mexico in 1821, following the country’s declaration of independence from Spain. Mexico’s defeat in the Mexican-American War forced it to cede California to the United States in 1848.After the US passed the Homestead Act of 1862, the first homesteaders started to arrive and settle in Big Sur. They lend their names to many local features, such as Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and Bixby Creek. The late 19th century was marked by the development of lumber and tanoak bark industries along with the Big Sur Gold Rush that created the area’s own boomtown at the head of Alder Creek. But the rugged and often impassable terrain did not allow for adequate infrastructure and industrial development, so the territory remained largely isolated until the construction of Highway 1. Its completion in 1937 ushered in a new era of recreation-focused commercial development. While the highway construction did adversely affect the area’s ecosystems, some of the first land preservation efforts were also initiated at that time.

Yet, the Sierra Nevada Range is only 10 million years old and was formed when the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block tilted and uplifted under the influence of tectonic forces in the region of the Great Basin.;The impact of the glaciers is evident through the U-shaped valleys of Cedar Grove, Paradise Valley, and Tehipite Valley. Tehipite Dome, the biggest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, was also formed by glaciers. Although nothing is left of those ancient glaciers these days, it doesn’t mean there are no glaciers in the parks: they are found on the highest peaks and they are surprisingly rather young (~1,000 years old). However, they are melting swiftly and it is very likely they will soon disappear because of rising temperatures.;;HistoryThe area of the park was originally populated by the Monache. They primarily occupied the vicinity of the Kaweah River (i.e., the Foothills region) but they also used the mountain passes as trade routes. European settlers brought with them diseases new to the Indigenous Peoples and as the result, their population shrank substantially in a short period of time. Another problem the Monache had to face was the loss of their lands as the settlers began actively using the natural resources of the area, the Giant Sequoia trees being one of them.;In 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established in an attempt to preserve the land and protect the trees from logging. Kings Canyon National Park was designated in 1940 largely because of (and thanks to!) John Muir’s activism. The two parks united in 1943 due to their closeness and similarities."

43789829-071a-4e6b-9fb8-d88418dfbed1;geologyAndHistory;GeologyThe volcanoes found in the Fremont portion of the Forest were formed earlier than mountains of the nearby Cascade Range. Tectonic shearing caused magma to rise to the surface. The process endured through the late Miocene Era (5-10 million years ago) and helped define the local topography of the mountains with gentle slopes on one side and sharp faces on the other.HistoryArcheological evidence shows that the beginning of the Fremont-Winema's human history took place approximately 14,500 years ago. The earliest residents of these lands were ancestors of the Klamath people, but the Paiute and Modoc also historically occupied this region. More than half of the Winema’s area used to comprise the Klamath’s territory, and the members of the tribe retain specific rights to use this part of the forest for hunting, fishing, and gathering of forest materials.From the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the First Nations Peoples competed with and were eventually forcibly moved from their homeland by Euro-American traders, who came for the area's rich natural resources.The Fremont National Forest was established in 1908 and received its name from Captain John C. Fremont, one of the pioneers to explore this land. The Winema National Forest was founded in 1961. A brave Modoc woman, Toby Riddle, who took part in the Modoc War of 1872 and went down in history as 'Winema' (woman chief) is the forest’s namesake. The two forests were united in 2002.

Two million years later, the lake was formed and shaped by glaciation, volcanoes, and erosion. About 7 thousand years ago, the lakeshores became covered with stands of conifers for the first time.Lake Tahoe is 22 miles in length, 12 miles in width, and 1,645 ft deep, with 72 miles of shoreline. It doesn’t freeze over in winter. Because of the elevation (6,225 ft.) prevents the growth of algae and the unique soil composition that works as a natural watershed filtering system, it is among the world’s clearest lakes. Unfortunately, due to the extensive human activity of the past decades, Tahoe’s legendary clarity has been reduced by 25%.HistoryThe area’s rich human history started 9,000 years ago. The earliest known residents of the land were Washoe Tribe, who first used the 10,000 square miles of land surrounding Lake Tahoe seasonally and then settled down.

Its topography, rocks, and soil bear witness to the region's volcanic and glacial past. According to studies, the oldest rocks in this section of the High Cascades started to form after multiple volcanic eruptions, between three and five million years ago.The Mount Mazama and Mount McLoughlin stratovolcanoes started to grow less than one million years ago, during the ‘Ice Age’, and the latter erupted for the last time between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago. The north and east sides of Mount McLoughlin show traces of it being carved out by the ice, and Seven Lakes Basin, Rogue River's Middle Fork, as well as other large drainages found in the Wilderness, were formed by glaciers, too.Rising temperatures melted the glaciers around 12,000 years ago, but the volcanic activity did not cease, although it occurred on a smaller scale. The formation of cinder cones, stretching from Goosenest Mountain north into Crater Lake National Park, also happened during this period.The eruption and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama, approximately 6,700 years ago, created the Crater Lake caldera, and left a blanket of pumice on the northern part of the Wilderness, which is commonly referred to as the ‘Oregon Desert’.HistoryThousands of years ago, the ancestors of the Klamath and the Takelma tribes used the area that is now known as Sky Lakes Wilderness for hunting and foraging. However, they did not create permanent settlements here due to adverse weather conditions that affect the area most of the year.;The first European settlers explored the area while hunting, trapping, grazing stock, and picking huckleberries.After the area came under the management of the USFS in 1906, the trails and fire lookout towers were built there.

4e0ab8d3-0872-4bd7-b47d-1565fb77f386;geologyAndHistory;"Lassen Volcanic National Park has a rich human history. The Lassen area first served as a meeting point and seasonal settlement for at least four Indigenous Tribes: the Atsugewi, Yana, Yahi, and Maidu. They used to go hunting and gathering in the Lassen region, though only in warmer months due to high elevation, snow conditions, and seasonally mobile deer populations. The Atsugewi split into two bands, the Atsuge and the Apwaruge, and settled the area around Hat Creek and Hat Creek Valley in winter, and for spring and summer, they moved to the Hat Creek and Lost Creek drainages.;Southeastern slopes, including Warner Valley and Juniper Lake, were inhabited by the Maidu Tribes. Their descendants still live in the land of their ancestors, regardless of conquest and settlement of tribal lands by European and American prospectors.;Most of the year, the foothills along Mill Creek and west-flowing waters were inhabited by Yana and Yahi, who traveled to higher elevations during warmer months.;The park’s namesake, Lassen Peak, was named after a Danish blacksmith, Peter Lassen, who guided newcomers in the 1830’s over the peak to the Sacramento Valley.;Lassen Volcanic National Park was originally designated as the Lassen Peak Forest Preserve. In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone U.S. National Monuments. Due to their striking volcanic beauty and erosion concerns, both of them, with the surrounding area, became Lassen Volcanic National Park in 1916.When it comes to geology, Lassen Volcanic National Park is situated in the most southern part of the Cascade Mountain Range. As well as the other volcanoes in the range, Lassen Peak is a part of the Cascade volcanic arc, stretching from southern British Columbia to northern California. The arc formed due to the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate. The process of Pacific Ocean tectonic plates plunging below the North American Plate has lasted hundreds of millions of years. Consequently, its magma has resulted in scores of striking volcanic landscapes in California, not to mention Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.;Between about 600,000 and 350,000 years ago, the western part of the park was taken over by Mount Tehama, a stratovolcano that formed a caldera about 3 miles in width. Several volcanic peaks occupy the rim of the now-eroded caldera. One of them being Lassen Peak, which periodically exploded between 1914 and 1921, with the most dramatic explosion in 1915.A few other glimpses of volcanic activity include Cinder Cone, Chaos Crags, and Bumpass Hell, the park’s largest geothermal area with bubbling mud pots, sulfurous vents, and steaming fumaroles. Lassen Volcanic National Park, one of just a few places in the world to do so, features all four volcano types: shield, composite, cinder cone, and plug dome.

A Scottish-American environmentalist, co-founder of the Sierra Club in 1892, father of the American wilderness preservation movement, and a skillful mountaineer, his actions were influential in preserving Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Park, and he served as an inspiration to protect numerous tracks of natural beauty across the country. John Muir was also the first to propound the idea that glaciers carved out much of Yosemite Valley; in contrast with Josiah Whitney’s now-disproved theory, which considered a catastrophic earthquake to be the reason to form the magnificent geology of Yosemite Valley. Together with the contribution to environmental awareness, John Muir inspired generations of Americans to preserve their health and freedom through simply walking in nature.;The eastern Sierra escarpment, where the John Muir Wilderness lies, was generated over 10 million years ago when the bedrock granite of the Sierra Nevada started rising. Simultaneously, what we now know as Antelope Valley, Long Valley, and the Owens Valley, began to settle along the Owens Valley fault line. Still to this day, the Sierra rises about 1.5 inches every century, which is really swift in terms of geological time.; The uplift rate lifts the terrain faster than erosion wears it down, which leads to ever-higher elevations. Also interesting, due to the fact that the Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range and features relatively little soil, flora and fauna here are restricted to only the hardiest species.;"

Nearly 90 percent of the island’s 76 square miles is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy, which was founded in 1972 as a non-profit organization to be good stewards of the lands through conservation, education, and recreation. Visitors to the island can go on a guided eco-tour in an open-top Jeep to explore parts of the island otherwise unreachable where a wide variety of plant and wildlife can be found - many endemic to Santa Catalina Island!Situated on the 21-mile long island are two major settlements: Avalon, and Two Harbors. Both are important hubs visitors can rely on for a variety of activities and services to meet their hiking, biking, and camping needs. There is also an airport on the island, but transportation on and about the island is mainly by use of golf carts. Don’t plan on bringing your personal vehicle with you, leave it parked on the mainland while you explore the beautiful views and diverse plant and wildlife on the island, including the American Bison, which were introduced to the island by movie producers in the 1920s and have lived there ever since.;"
51cbab88-462b-421e-abcd-7c48aa99910f;wildlifeInfo;"Due to a variety of reasons ranging from the proximity of the island to the mainland to its sheer size and the presence of a sizable human population on the island, Santa Catalina Island has a wider diversity of animals than any of the other Channel Islands, making the island a great place to observe wildlife. Please remember not to disturb the wildlife.It is noteworthy to mention that the island is home to the most number of reptiles and amphibians of all the Channel Islands. There are two species of frogs and four species of lizards, including the fairly aggressive California Alligator Lizard which likes to hide under rocks and logs, so be careful where you put your hands. While these lizards are often taken care of as pets, they are handled by humans from birth. A wild alligator lizard will probably bite if you try to pick it up, so if you see one, leave it be. There are also two species of salamanders, and six snake species inhabiting the island, including the striped California Kingsnake and the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake, which usually only bites humans when directly threatened. So, again, please do not disturb the wildlife.In addition to amphibians and reptiles, Santa Catalina Island is home to four species of ungulates, a fancy word that refers to large mammals with hooves. Among the ungulates on Santa Catalina Island are the American Bison, which was brought onto the island for a movie and left behind after production, the grass-eating Blackbuck Antelope, which was introduced from India and Nepal and recognizable by its long, twisted, spiral-like horns, as well as horses and mule deer.Santa Catalina Island is also home to nearly fifty species of birds, including woodpeckers, owls, eagles, falcons, hawks, and a variety of hummingbirds. From sparrows to swallows, from coots to wrens, and everything in between, the island is a hub of activity for birds, including the Loggerhead Shrike, a bird endemic to the Channel Islands which feeds on insects and small vertebrates. To catch a glimpse of these predatory birds, head out to a canyon mouth on the ocean side of the island. Meanwhile, there are at least eight species of bats inhabiting Santa Catalina Island.No island is without marine life and Santa Catalina Island is no exception. Here, while visiting the island, you will be able to observe sea lions and seals, including Elephant Seals and Harbor Seals.Santa Catalina Island is home to more than 400 native and 200 non-native plants, including seven endemic species that are only found on this island. Many of the island’s plants are categorized by the state and/or federal government as endangered or threatened species.One of the plants endemic to Santa Catalina Island is the Santa Catalina Island mountain-mahogany, a plant in the rose family that the Center for Plant Conservation calls “one of the rarest shrubs in the continental United States” and “one of the rarest trees in North America”. If you want to catch a glimpse of this rare plant, you’ll have to head out to Wild Boar Gully.Another interesting aspect of plant life on Santa Catalina Island is the present of the so-called fire followers. They are called this because they require high temperatures to germinate and prefer growing in charate, or ashy burned material. Hopefully, the island will remain safe from wildfires, but if you visit the island after a wildfire occurs, you may be able to catch a glimpse of these Catalina native “fire-activated” species. One particular species is noteworthy considering the state flower of California is the golden poppy. After the Goat Harbor fire in 1999, the “fire poppy”, which had never been recorded on Santa Catalina Island, was discovered!;Santa Catalina Island also has a majestic wildflower season, with the bloom usually occurring between February and May. One of the wildflowers commonly observed during the bloom season is called “shooting star”... and we’ll leave it to your imagination as to how special and beautiful that flower is. You’ll just have to make a trip to see it with your own eyes!;The best way to explore the diverse plant life on Santa Catalina Island, from the native to non-native species and the wildflower bloom is by open-air guided tour with a naturalist in a Jeep. For that, you’ll have to make a reservation by calling (310) 510-2595 and asking for ext. 108."
51cbab88-462b-421e-abcd-7c48aa99910f;geologyAndHistory;"Catalina Island is a relatively young island in geologic terms when you consider that the westernmost of the Hawaiian Islands formed as much as 65 million years ago and that the island of Madagascar is even much older than that. In contrast, Santa Catalina Island formed just 3-5 million years ago as a result of tectonic plate activity, unlike Madagascar, which geologists believe was physically connected to Africa and began to drift away from the continent as a result of a major earthquake. Santa Catalina Island was never connected to the mainland continent of North America.;Due to weathering and erosion and the proximity of algae and cyanobacteria in the ocean, plant life was able to get established on the island. This early plant life was eventually joined by more plants, as well as animals, which arrived by the three W’s: wind, wing, or wave. A separate evolutionary process occurred over many years in which there were fewer predators and less competition due to isolation from the mainland. This explains, for example, why the squirrels on Santa Catalina Island are larger than on the mainland, but the foxes are smaller.;The Tongva people were the first humans to inhabit the island. They inhabited the island for some 8,000 years and there were about 3,000 of them living there when Europeans arrived in the mid-1500s. In the late 1770s, the Spanish established the San Gabriel Mission and renamed the Tongva inhabitants Gabrielinos. Since the arrival of Europeans, Santa Catalina Island has experienced change.Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, and a Mexican governor transferred the island to private ownership in 1848, two years before California (together with Santa Catalina Island) would be admitted to the United States as the 31st state.;The completion of the trans-continential railroad brough investors and entrepreneurs into California from back east and the ownership of Santa Catalina Island changed hands many times until it was acquired by the Banning Brothers, who, in 1984, established the Santa Catalina Island Company. This company is still the owner of the island today. Avalon was named around that same time and it was also then that the first hotel and pier were built there.Almost a century later, the Santa Catalina Island Company transferred most (88%) of the island’s acreage to be cared for by the newly formed Catalina Island Conservancy, which was established in 1972 and continues to be the steward of the island to this day.;"

They’ll independently complete activities to help them learn about the park, its landscapes, and the Indigenous Peoples’ who have inhabited these lands for over 10,000 years.;"
5208d1b3-413b-4ea3-b3f2-2315b9f0ef03;wildlifeInfo;"Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has abundant wildlife communities, though due to its location along the shore, these animals naturally move in and out of the park at will. Visitors to Sleeping Bear Dunes can expect to encounter white-tailed deer, red foxes, squirrels, bats, and raccoons. As its name suggests, you may also see black bears during your visit.In addition to these common mammals, the National Park Service has cataloged over 50 other mammals, 21 species of amphibians, 20 species of reptiles, over 300 species of birds, and over 100 species of fish which are present or historically have been present in the lands that are now Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.Reptile species mostly include various snakes and turtles, including the snapping turtle and garter snake, while toads, frogs, and newts are the most likely amphibians you may come across. Common birds include woodpeckers, robins, bluebirds, wrens, sparrows, warblers, doves, wild turkeys, mute swans, and Canadian Geese.Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is known for its diverse array of biological communities and micro-habitats. As such, you will be pleasantly surprised by the diversity of natural landscapes you may encounter while visiting the park. These landscapes range from forests to glacial features and from wetlands to sand dunes.The area is also ripe with plenty of vegetation and a wide array of plant life.In fact, there are over 1,300 species of vascular plants in Sleeping Bear Dunes! Several species of maple, birch, pine, oak, and sumac trees make up the forests. Poison sumac is also probably present, according to the National Park Service, as is poison ivy and poison parsnip, so be careful where you wander.You may also come across various fruits and nuts growing in Sleeping Bear Dunes. These include blueberries, raspberries, and cranberries. Many of the berries growing here, such as chokeberries, are astringent when consumed raw (which is where chokeberries got their name). Always check reputable sources to properly identify raw berries before consuming.;"
5208d1b3-413b-4ea3-b3f2-2315b9f0ef03;geologyAndHistory;"Sleeping Bear Dunes is named after the largest sand dune in the park, known as Mother Bear.; In the past, it strongly resembled a sleeping bear. The native Ashininaabek people used this dune as a landmark and offered two different oral traditions on how it came to be.; If you like, you can read them on the National Park Service Story of Sleeping Bear Dunes page.Congress designated this area a National Lakeshore in 1970 to protect its outstanding natural features, sand dune formations, and ancient glacial phenomena. The creation of this National Lakeshore was controversial in that it required the federal government to acquire privately-owned lands from unwilling owners. It took about 7 years for the bulk of the land to be acquired - often through court battles - and in 1977 the lakeshore was officially dedicated.; Fortunately, it was worth protecting, and in 2011, it won the “Most Beautiful Place in America” title by ABC’s Good Morning America.The area that makes up Sleeping Bear Dunes was created largely by natural processes stemming from the last Ice Age during which glaciers and ice expanded south from the Arctic and covered much of Canada and the northern United States. The expansion of ice carved features into the Earth and when they retreated some 11,000 years ago, the melting ice left fresh water, rivers, and lakes, including the Great Lakes, in their trail. The receding ice also deposited sand and rocks along the way.During the Ice Age, Indigenous People used these lands as seasonal hunting grounds, as weather permitted, but as the ice continued to melt and recede, they began inhabiting these lands on a more permanent basis. Archaeological evidence suggests that the people here were engaged in trade with other Indigenous People as far away as Florida.In the thousands of years since, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has been constantly reshaped by wind, erosion, and other natural processes, resulting in the park we have today. The sand dunes along the beach, for example, exist in large part thanks to the presence of sand deposits blown by westerly winds across Lake Michigan. The larger dunes high above the shoreline and on the plateaus owe their existence to the sands deposited by glaciers in times past.European explorers, especially the French, began arriving in the 1620s. Indigenous People shared their agricultural techniques with them, and taught them about birch bark canoes, which assisted them with successfully exploring the Great Lakes at great speeds.;"

537b7e4b-b4ef-4702-9fa6-7f88d8401eb6;geologyAndHistory;"The Sierra National Forest was the second national forest in California. Initially, it comprised more than six million acres and covered sections of eight counties.; It was granted its Forest Reserve status in 1893 by the proclamation of President Harrison and became a National Forest in 1907. In 1908, the Sequoia National Forest, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks were separated from the Sierra NF's southern part. Eastern portions turned into the Inyo and Toiyabe National Forests, while northern parts were set aside for Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest.Humans have inhabited the Sierra National Forest for at least 13,500 years. The forest is believed to be the ancestral homeland of numerous groups; amongst them are the Sierra Me-Wuk, Shoshone Mono, Washo, Monache, and Yokuts. By the middle of the eighteenth century, European-Americans arrived in the region, primarily hunting for gold. Unfortunately, during the California Gold Rush, Indigenous Peoples were displaced from these lands by foreign newcomers.;When it comes to geology, the Sierra NF is part of the greater Sierra Nevada Range. Most bedrock here was formed due to the subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath the North American plate, which led to profuse volcanic activity in the area. Finally, this resulted in the Sierra Batholith formation,; which is an accumulation of igneous plutons. About 10 million years ago, this region experienced an uplift along the Sierra fault, which helped to form what we now know as the Sierra Nevada mountain range. However, the National Forest's current shape was carved out mostly due to extensive glaciation of the area in the Pleistocene Era. This process formed numerous mountains and valleys scattered throughout the forest nowadays.;"

The Trinity Alps Wilderness is located in an outstanding mountain range in Northern California that offers excellent backpacking opportunities among its craggy granite peaks, fragile valleys, evergreen fir forests, crystal clear streams, and charming alpine lakes.; The Wilderness is jointly administered by the Shasta-Trinity, Klamath, and Six Rivers National Forests.Scattered in the Salmon and Scott Mountains, subranges of the larger Klamath Mountains, the Trinities are noted for their scenic views, an alpine environment, and solitude, which hikers will enjoy while being immersed in the area’s nature. Remote northwestern California gets far fewer visitors, and thus less impact, on its pristine lands. To enjoy the Trinity Alps beauty, one should be ready to spend several days investigating the trails and sleeping under the stars, as car campers don’t have many options for a visit.;Trinity Alps’ crown jewels are the White Trinities, lying in the wilderness’s heart and featuring its highest granite peaks and largest lakes. Old volcanic rocks will make you think about ancient times when most of California was rising from the depths of the ocean. Emerald, Sapphire, Caribou, and Boulder lakes are also highlights of this area, so be sure to visit at least some (if not all) of them."

In the early nineteenth century, Europeans first came to the area when a mountain man, Jedidiah Smith, passed through the Alps as a part of a traverse through the western coast of North America in 1826.; Smith and following expeditions encountered the Wintu Tribe; unfortunately, their contact resulted in a malaria outbreak that horrifically killed an estimated 75% of the Indigenous Peoples in the area.; Coupled with resource competition and violence against the Tribe, the disease reduced their numbers from 14,000 to just 400 by 1910.;The Reading Expedition was undertaken in 1845 and resulted in the present-day name, as Major Reading erroneously assumed that Trinity River flowed to Trinidad Bay (in fact, it flows into the Klamath River).During the Gold Rush, many prospectors and miners headed for what we now know as the Trinity Alps, where gold deposits could match those of the “Klondike” in Alaska and Canada. At present, the mountains still have remnants of that mining activity, which stretched from the 1850s through to the 1940s.;As for geology, the wilderness may be divided into three sections: Green, Red, and White Trinities due to different landscapes and rock layers found in the Klamath Mountains region. The western edge features the Green Trinities, with lush, heavy forests lying in low elevations.; In this, the least popular section, one will definitely find a piece of solitude.;The Red Trinities rise above Trinity Lake and make up the eastern border. The most rugged of Trinity Alps’, this part is abundant with lake basins and impressive towering peaks over 8,000 feet. The name comes from red serpentine and peridotite rock formations. Numerous lakes and mountain ranges also intersect the 17 miles of The Pacific Crest Trail running through this section.;Between these two regions is the last but not least of the Trinities, the White ones.; This is the most visited section in the entire wilderness, which is profuse with white granite peaks, striking views, and dozens of lakes. Some compare the White Trinities with the rugged peaks and glaciated valleys of Sierra Nevada."

The last survivor of the Yahi, a division of the larger Yana People, sought refuge in one of the Lassen’s parts,; now known as the Ishi Wilderness. As the story goes, the Yahi were fierce and reclusive - and also lived closest to the goldfields - so when the first settlers came to the area, there were many struggles between the two groups for land and resources.; Without guns, the Yahi were no match for the settlers, and multiple genocidal raids were carried out against them.; The last few Yahi’s hid deep in the Sierra until 1911 when Ishi emerged from the wilderness after his mother and remaining relatives had passed away.;Long before the federal wilderness system, Caribou Wilderness became one of the first areas to receive protection from the US government. Lassen NF was established in 1905 as Lassen Peak Reserve, with some of its land coming from Diamond Mountain National Forest and also in an exchange of lands with Plumas and Shasta National Forests in 1908.; Lassen Volcanic National Park was annexed from the forest in 1916 when the National Park Service was established.;The highest summit in both Lassen National Forest and Lassen Volcanic National Park, and the Cascade’s most southern volcano, Lassen Peak, was named after a Danish blacksmith, Peter Lassen who guided newcomers in the 1830’s over the peak to the Sacramento Valley.Unlike most California peaks, Lassen’s mountains are part of the Cascade Range, which extends throughout the Pacific Northwest.; Along with the other Cascade volcanoes, Lassen Peak belongs to the Cascade volcanic arc, which formed due to the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate. The process of Pacific Oceanic tectonic plates plunging below the North American Plate has lasted hundreds of millions of years. Consequently, its magma has resulted in scores of striking volcanic landscapes in California, not to mention Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.; Lassen Peak and Mount Saint Helens remain the only two volcanoes in the entire Cascade volcanic arc which produced major explosions over the last two centuries. Lassen Peak periodically exploded between 1914 and 1921, with the most dramatic eruption in 1915. And while there are no active glaciers in Lassen NF, its landscape was significantly shaped by extensive glaciation in the Pleistocene. It led to numerous striking features we can observe today.;"

Major peaks consist of olivine-bearing andesite, while cinder cones are basically made of gray to red basaltic and andesitic pyroclastic rocks. Relatively recent volcanic activity in the High Cascades is evident in the layers of pumice and ash covering the bedrock. The Western Cascades were not affected by the series of volcanic eruptions due to the winds which carried volcanic ash eastwards. One more significant fact about the High Cascades is that there is an obsidian source, as well as vast metal deposits in the area, which makes the place really attractive to explorers - leading us to human history.HistoryThe course of the Willamette National Forest’s history was highly affected by the resources of the Willamette Valley and the adjacent western slopes of the Cascade Range.; Ancient ancestors of the Kalapuya and Chinook Tribes were in the area at least 8,000 years ago - the two tribes had lived on the Wilamette’s shores relatively undisturbed until the area was discovered by Europeans.;;The exploration began in the early 1800’s when a group of fur-traders led by Robert Stuart and hunters led by Donald McKenzie (remember the Wild &amp; Scenic McKenzie River!), as well as some others, came to the Willamette Valley. Rich with gold, timber, and other natural resources, the western Cascades was of great interest for gold seekers, fur-traders, and lumbermen.; Very soon the first actual settlements occurred and started to expand, and by the middle of the 19th century the Valley was rather filled - which means the territory of the present Willamette National Forest was being highly exploited.; During this time, diseases ran rampant through the Chinook and Kalapuya Tribes and their populations declined catastrophically.; The surviving Indigenous Peoples eventually ratified treaties to move onto the Grand Ronde Reservation, where their descendants still live today.In 1893, the Cascade Range Forest Reserve was established and extended from the Columbia River on Oregon’s northern border almost all the way to its southern border with California.; In 1907 the large forest reserve was split into three - the Oregon, Cascadia, and Umpqua National Forests.; Just a few years later, in 1911, the Cascadia NF was split in two and renamed the Santiam and Cascade National Forests.; Finally, in 1933, the Santiam and Cascade NF’s were recombined to form the Willamette National Forest.;In the 1930’s and ‘40’s, the Civilian Conservation Corps made great contributions to Forest’s trail network, recreation facilities, and the overall ecological environment.; The Corps added to the area’s appeal by building the Dee Wright Observatory in the Lava Beds at McKenzie Pass, planting trees, constructing campgrounds on the South Fork of the McKenzie, and putting in a three-mile trail from Trout Creek camp to Rooster Lookout, among other things."

The last period of ice coverage took place 13,000–14,000 years ago, and about 11,000 years ago the territory saw its first people. Many tribes, including the Crow, Umatilla, Shoshone, Bannock, and Blackfeet, consider the land now designated as Yellowstone to be their home or hunting grounds. They hunted here and created transportation routes that were used before and after European American arrival. This area was ignored by the newcomers for quite a long time, as the first detailed expeditions did not take place until 1869.;The area’s magnificence immediately swayed the government into believing that it needed protection; Yellowstone began operating as the world's first national park in 1872.;The Yellowstone River headwaters gave the park its name. At the end of the 18th century, French trappers named this river Roche Jaune, which is a rough translation of the Hidatsa Tribe’s Mi tsi a-da-zi (""Yellow Rock River""). The American trappers then translated the French name to ""Yellow Stone"" in English, and thus the familiar epithet was born.Of course, Yellowstone National Park became popular due to its volcanic activity.;The park’s history actually goes back to the older activity found in the Snake River Plain, whose hotspot later moved northeast to the Yellowstone area. Some scientists assert that a mantle plume is the reason for the hotspot’s migration, while another theory holds that fragmentation of the subducted Farallon Plate in Earth's interior caused this hotspot to move.Old Faithful Geyser is definitely the most popular geyser in Yellowstone and perhaps the most famous in the world. Along with Castle Geyser, Lion Geyser, and Beehive Geyser, it is located in the Upper Geyser Basin. The largest active geyser in the world, Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin, is a part of Yellowstone NP as well. In 2011 scientists completed a study that found at least 1283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone, with 465 of them still active.;Due to its endless geothermal process, every year the park experiences thousands of small earthquakes, yet all of them are non-hazardous and undetectable to people.80% of the area is covered by forest, with grassland occupying most of the rest. The Middle Rocky Mountains bound the Yellowstone Plateau (~8,000 ft above sea level) on nearly all sides. The highest point here is Eagle Peak (11,372 ft).

Located on the Colorado Plateau in northwestern Arizona, the canyon serves as a window into the geological past of this area. The Colorado Plateau was uplifted about 65 million years ago as a result of tectonic movements of the Earth's crust. The uplift changed the Colorado River’s stream gradient, so its current speed increased. For millions of years, the river cut at the rocks, deepening and widening the canyon. Architectured by water, gravity, wind, and time, the Grand Canyon is a masterpiece of Nature’s art.;The area has always attracted people: some petroglyphs found in the park date back about three thousand years. The Ancestral Puebloans were the first known inhabitants of the Grand Canyon, and for centuries this place was their home, as well as for Cohonina, Sinagua, and Navajo tribes. Since the 16th century, Europeans have been exploring the Grand Canyon. In 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Grand Canyon. Impressed by its beauty, he decided to preserve the area for future generations. As a national park, Grand Canyon began operating in 1919. In 2019, Grand Canyon NP celebrated its 100th anniversary."

The following years were incredibly difficult for the tribe due to resource and land competition and violent conflicts with the prospectors.; Finally, in 2002, the tribe was officially given custody, for cultural purposes, of the land around Lake Tahoe.;Federally designated under the California Wilderness Act of 1984, the Granite Chief Wilderness currently protects an exceptional part of the Tahoe National Forest.;When it comes to geology, the Granite Chief Wilderness lies within the legendary Sierra Nevada range. Its landscape is underlain primarily by plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks, which are part of the Sierra Batholith. The latter represents an extensive cluster of plutons formed when the Farallon Plate subducted below the North American Plate about 100 million years ago.With the Sierra Nevada rising, a considerable part of metamorphic rock, except for the western foothills, was worn away from the range. As the volcanic rock was sedimented over the existing ground about 4 million years ago, a big portion of it eroded; - leaving the metamorphic rocks mainly on the ridge crests.;Two neighboring peaks, Granite and Squaw Peaks are a perfect example of the local geology, with Squaw Peak composed of volcanic rock and Granite Peak underlaid by granite outcroppings.;;One of the most astonishing geological features in the region is the Rubicon River Canyon and its radially shaped fan dikes (a dike is a rock that cuts through another type of rock).

Due to mounting pressure on land and resources, the Indigenous Tribes started signing treaties to move their people onto Warm Springs Reservation.Deschutes National Forest was established in 1908 when parts of the Cascade, Blue Mountains, and Fremont National Forests were merged. Later, in 1911, the forest underwent more transformations: parts of it were cut to establish Ochoco and Paulina NFs, while some lands of the Oregon and Cascade Forests were attached to the Deschutes. And finally, in 1915, the area of Paulina National Forest was added back to the Deschutes National Forest, shaping it to its present-day form.;As for geological history, the Deschutes National Forest is a very young volcanic region with a wide spectrum of glacial and volcanic landforms, some of which are said to be unique for the United States.

In 1827, Jedidiah Smith, an American trader and explorer, traversed the area at Ebbetts Pass, and in 1841, the Bartleson–Bidwell Party crossed north of Sonora Pass on their way from Missouri to California (probably not far from Kit Carson and his company).As the result of the California Gold Rush in the middle of the 19th century, the settlements developed and people began actively using the land for livestock grazing. The cattle and sheep grazing allotments are still found to this day within Carson-Iceberg even though it was designated wilderness in 1984 and has been officially protected since then.;GeologyThe Carson-Iceberg Wilderness encompasses a section of the Sierra Nevada range spreading across both its eastern and western slopes. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan Orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today. One of the masterpieces left by the glaciers, a granite formation near the Clark Fork Road called ‘Iceberg’ gave its name to the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. The landscape of the area deviates from the rest of the range as the dark volcanic peaks dominate here in contrast to the light-reflecting granite found elsewhere throughout the Sierra. "

When pioneers mistook the word for montaña, they designated the mountain with the name Diablo.;Mount Diablo State Park was established in 1921, and in 1976 Mount Diablo was designated as a California Registered Historical Landmark due to its high importance to Indigenous People. GeologyMount Diablo is not a volcano but a geologic anomaly established due to the folding and faulting of the Earth’s plates over the past few million years. Interestingly, the mountain represents a volcanic rock that erupted thousands of miles to the west from underwater volcanoes and moved to the region it is now due to tectonic plates’ movement. As the summit lies where earthquake faults meet, it still keeps growing from three to five millimeters annually.

No matter what your ideal getaway may be, King Range Conservation Area can guarantee respite, as the area’s geography is too rugged even for highways.In addition to its 68,000 acres of secluded wilderness, King Range Conservation Area surrounds King Range Wilderness, the longest undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States of America. It is due to its proximity to the cold ocean water of the Pacific that temperatures here average out to about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But that is not the only role the ocean plays in defining this wilderness area. In fact, the unique geography of King Range Conservation Area makes it a special place to visit, as this is where rugged, forested mountains and sheer cliffs meet the ocean, making it a place you have to see with your own eyes!;Now, many people think Seattle is the rainiest place in the country but almost three times as much rain falls in King Range Conservation Area on an annual basis than does in the Emerald City some 700 miles further north along the coast. Thus, King Range Conservation Area is one of the wettest places in the country, and the wettest place in California thanks to the area’s extreme topographical relief which causes massive amounts of orographic rainfall.It is to this rainfall that King Range Conservation Area owes its spectacular biological and botanical diversity. In addition to supporting undisturbed, ancient Douglas fir and oak forests, King Range Conservation Area is home to some 250 endangered species, as well as some iconic residents like the bald eagle and at least 300 other native and migratory birds, making King Range Conservation Area a paradise for ornithologists and bird watchers alike.

Specifically, tectonic forces have caused earthquakes and have otherwise uplifted the land, while weather and the ocean have eroded the surface, forming its features. In this way, the King Range Conservation Area is a rugged coastal mountain range that runs parallel with the San Andreas fault, which is responsible for this uplifting. In geologic terms, these mountains are relatively new, with many of the features having been formed just 20 million years ago.;This geology has played a role in the areas history and development, or the lack thereof. For example, California State Route 1 is a famous highway that runs north-south along the Pacific coast but due to the rugged terrain of what is now King Range Conservation Area, engineers in the 1930s were forced to build and pave the highway away from the coast, leaving the “Lost Coast” as it is now known, the longest undeveloped stretch of coast in California.Decades later in 1970, Congress designated 60,000 acres of the coastal range mountains as the King Range National Conservation Area. The federally protected lands in this area were further extended when President Clinton designated the rocks and islands offshore from the King Range National Conservation Area as the “California Coast National Monument” in 2000. Then, Congress designated 42,585 acres of the National Conservation Area as the King Range Wilderness in 2006."

The bands included the Kalapuyans, Molalas, Chinookan Clackamas, Shinookan Wascas, Northern Paiutes, and Sahaptins.Fascinating enough, Middle and Upper Chinookan bands had a trail system, which almost runs concurrently with the modern Pacific Crest Trail.;The tribes referred to Mount Hood as a sacred place. The legend goes that the Great Spirit became angry with his sons who were fighting over a woman, and turned all three into well-known mountains: Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood. Originally Mount Hood was known as Wy'est, and the word still lives in the names of local streets, businesses, and buildings.;The first Europeans who visited the area were British officers in 1792, who were followed by Lewis and Clark in 1805-06. The Mount Hood National Forest received its first official designation in 1892. The forest has a rich history of names. For one year, it was known as Bull Run Timberland Reserve, then the Cascade Range Forest Reserve.; When the US Forest Service was formed, the area was renamed again and referred to as the Oregon National Forest. Finally, in 1924 the forest was named after its most famous mountain, as the Mount Hood National Forest. Many attempts were made to change its status to that of a National Park and forbid logging operations but without success. By the 1920’s, the forest received more and more visitors and gained more popularity.;As people living around the forest needed job opportunities, especially during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed and provided a lot of them. The newly employed would go on to help build campgrounds, trails, and the famous Timberline Lodge. The largest project by that time, the lodge was formally opened by FDR in 1937, and it was declared Oregon's tenth National Historic Landmark in 1977. For all the trivia buffs out there, it also appeared in the movie The Shining. Being constructed as a ski lodge, Timberline Lodge still retains its original purpose today.From the geologic point of view, it is Mount Hood itself, a stratovolcano, that can be considered as one of the most curious features of the forest. A part of the Cascade Range, it was formed by glacial and volcanic activities, and is currently home to eleven glaciers. It has erupted sporadically for 500,000 years, but for the last 200 years, it has been inactive except for a few minor eruptions. For more information on its geology, visit Oregon Encyclopedia. "

What we now call the Marble Mountains once was part of an ancient, shallow ocean’s bottom. Dramatic volcanic eruptions and glacial activity helped form the Marble Mountains millions of years ago. In the past 2 million years, glacial erosion eliminated the area’s deep soils and carved spectacular lakes and U-shaped valleys. The wilderness itself is composed of terranes, a series of fault-bounded rock units or crusts, aged from 145 to 570 million years old.;The wilderness namesake, Marble Mountain, remains one of the most notable features in the Klamath.

78e6c66a-ee0d-4487-9e89-86f2efdd93c7;geologyAndHistory;"Mount Mazama started rising half a million years ago; over the years, lava flowing from numerous volcanic vents overlapped and built a volcano with a peculiar shape. When this ancient volcano erupted about 7,700 years ago, creating the largest explosion in North America in the last half a million years, Crater Lake was formed.;This is how it happened: a large flow of hot gas and liquid volcanic rock burst into the air, followed by the lava falling back to the earth. In fact, ash from that explosion still lies in the soils of Alberta, Canada, which is over 1,000 miles away from the lake. Because of the explosions on the eastern side of the mountain, swift flows of hot lava poured out of the volcano. These flows totaled an astounding 12 cubic miles, completely emptying the magma chamber. As a result, with the mountain’s support had disappeared, its walls started collapsing inwards, and what was formed during the course of hundreds of thousands of years presumably faded away in just several days.;After this, a few minor explosions occurred inside the caldera and produced Wizard Island and Merriam Cone,; which is hidden under the water’s surface. Interestingly, Mount Scott on the eastern side of the lake is formed by the oldest rocks we can see today, at 420,000 years of age.;When it comes to human history, Native Americans inhabited the region until the cataclysmic explosion at Mount Mazama. Archaeologists have discovered different artifacts below layers of ash, dust, and pumice - pieces of evidence of the dramatic eruption. The Klamath people tell of a legend of the creation of Crater Lake, which correlates with the geologic story. The legend narrates about two spirits, Chief of the Below World, Llao, who lived below Lao-Yaina (today known as Mount Mazama), and Skell, Chief of the Above World. After Loha, the daughter of the Klamath Tribe’s chief, rejected Llao, he decided to take revenge on her people. Skell descended to the top of Mount Shasta to help the people. Soon Skell and Llao started fighting and were thundering and trembling the Earth. Thinking they would pay for the tribe’s sins, two men made up their minds to sacrifice themselves and jumped into the pit of the Below-World. Impressed by their heroic move, Skell fought even harder and eventually defeated Llao, banishing him deep into the Below-World. Skell then ruined Mount Mazama’s top to trap Llao beneath the earth forever. Skell also wished quiet and tranquility to hide this gloomy pit and filled it with crystal clear blue water.;Three pioneers, John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters, were trying to discover the legendary “Lost Cabin” gold mine just when they came across the lake in 1853. They referred to it as the bluest lake they’d ever seen, but as gold was more of their concern, the discovery was soon forgotten. In 1865, the lake was found again by two hunters.; Sergeant Orsen Sterns became the first non-Native American to descend to Crater Lake. Soon, Captain F.B. Sprague followed him and proposed to name it “Lake Majesty.” In 1869, Jim Sutton, newspaper editor with several others, first lowered a boat into the lake. He eventually called it “Crater Lake,” and the name stuck.;Astounded by Crater Lake, William Gladstone Steel devoted his life to the establishment and administration of Crater Lake National Park. After his first look at the hypnotizing beauty of the lake, it took him 17 years to make his dream come true. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the bill that granted Crater Lake its official status as a national park.;"

80c0bc2b-4657-47f9-8edf-c88119e1c707;geologyAndHistory;"GeologyThe geologic structure of the Mokelumne Wilderness is composed of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks, granodiorites, and the remnants of volcanic flows. As the territory of the Wilderness covers a portion of the central Sierra Nevada, its geology is closely related to the Sierra Nevada geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. Between 20 and 4 million years ago, multiple volcanoes erupted, leaving the mountains blanketed in lava and ash. Elephant Back, Round Top, and Thimble Peaks are examples of the extant ancient volcanoes that were active during that period. However, those mountains and volcanic rock have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today and carved the bowl-shaped cirques, U-shaped valleys, moraines, and erratic boulders that define the local terrain.If you are interested in the geology of the Mokelumne Wilderness you can also check this brief overview on the Eldorado NF’s website.HistoryThe area, which is now known as Mokelumne Wilderness, has attracted people for a long time. First Peoples started to come here about 10,000 years ago. The Washoe and Sierra Me-Wuk used these lands for hunting and foraging, and also developed some trade routes to exchange abalone shells, salts, obsidian, rabbit skins, baskets, acorns, and pine nuts.;In 1848, during the Mexican-American War, the religious unit of the U.S. army called the Mormon Battalion crossed the Mokelumne Wilderness along its northwest boundary on their way to Salt Lake City. The route they followed became exceedingly popular with gold prospectors over the next decade. The 1860's were marked by a short period of silver mining which took place near the Blue Lakes. By the beginning of the 20th herdsmen started using the region for seasonal grazing.;The Mokelumne Wilderness was established in 1964 and in 1984 its territory was enlarged by 55,000 acres."

81448005-93f7-4aaa-8a96-9f7d6a2f8d83;geologyAndHistory;"Henry W. Coe State Park has a rich history. About 10,000 years ago, many nomadic tribes lived on and hunted for deer and elk within what is now the park’s area. There are archaeological artifacts and remains of the Northern Valley Yokut, Ohlone, and Amuh Mutsun peoples’ village settlements along water sources throughout the region, which they inhabited until the late 1700’s when Spanish missionaries moved into the area.These hills were further inhabited by sheepherders, outlaws, cattlemen, and prospectors seeking valuable minerals after the Gold Rush in 1849. The La Vereda del Monte, a trail that meandered its way through the backcountry of Henry W. Coe State Park between Pleasanton and the Diablo Range, was used for the transportation of stolen horses and mustangs before they were sold in Sonora.;Homesteaders laid claim to portions of land throughout the region, the most notable being Henry Coe, Mike Mahoney, Horace Willson, Perry Dowdy, and the Robison brothers. The Pine Ridge Ranch was founded by Henry W. Coe and his family, where they lived until the son sold the ranch to the Beach Land and Cattle Company in 1948 after Henry Coe’s passing. The ranch was later donated to Santa Clara County by his daughter, Sada Coe, and shortly afterward Henry Willard Coe County Park was signed into law.It was designated as a state park in 1958, and it continues to grow to this day. However, the northern sections of the park, including the Orestimba Wilderness, suffered major impact from a wildfire in 2007.In terms of geology, the park is mostly comprised of rock types typical of the Diablo Range: sandstone, chert, greenstone, blueschist, and serpentine. It is characterized by a series of ridges that alternate with deep steep canyons. Elevations of the ridges range from 2,000 ft. to 3,000 ft., while the elevation of the canyons is generally about 1,000-1,500 ft. The most notable peaks and ridges include Willow Ridge, Rooster Comp, Mount Sizer, and Wilson Peak. A very detailed account of Henry W. Coe State Park’s geology can be read on the Pine Ridge Association’s website.;"

The volcano was formed as a result of the subduction of an oceanic tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate. A series of eruptions began about 300,000 years ago and continued for hundreds of thousands of years. The most serious explosive eruption took place in the late Pleistocene, and the latest episode is dated to 15,000 years ago during the last major glaciation. Relatively young lava flows found south of Mount Jefferson indicate that the volcano remains potentially active.;Let us look closer at the history of the volcano’s name and the human history of the area. The first Americans to reach Mount Jefferson were Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark (Lewis &amp; Clark) who headed there as part of the Corps of Discovery Expedition.The goal of the expedition, commissioned by Thomas Jefferson in 1803, was to explore the lands newly acquired from France, find trade route opportunities, and establish American authority among the Indigenous Peoples along the Missouri River. The expedition resulted in a vast scope of geographical, geological, ethnological, botanical, and zoological discoveries. Eventually, the mountain was named after the sponsor of the expedition.;"

The park is named after the saguaro - a giant cactus species that can grow up to 52 feet tall, 30 inches in diameter, and live up to 200 years. Saguaro is one of the main symbols of the Southwest, and it is often called “the monarch of the desert”.The city of Tucson divides the park into two separate areas called “districts”: Tucson Mountain District in the West and Rincon Mountain District in the East. Each district offers a different experience, and everyone can find something for their liking. The western part of the park features a denser saguaro forest and is more popular for tourists, though it is closed for overnight camping. You can see gigantic cacti in their natural habitat, explore ancient petroglyphs of prehistoric Hohokam people, watch a marvelous sunset at Gates Pass, enjoy a scenic drive, or visit the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.Rincon Mountain District is a less visited area that can provide you with some solitude. With elevations ranging from 2,670 to over 8,000 feet, the park’s eastern section encompasses diverse landscapes from desert to oak woodland and mixed conifer forests.

Exposed volcanic rocks can be seen on the Tucson Mountain District's surface and act as reminders of the area’s geological past (interestingly, they are not found in the Rincon Mountain District).Hohokam are known as the earliest residents of the Saguaro area. According to petroglyphs and historical artifacts, they inhabited the modern Tucson Mountain District region between 200 and 1450 CE. The Hohokam harvested Saguaro fruits to make syrup and jam.;The Tucson Basin was occupied first by Latinx, Mexican, and later American settlers, when Arizona became a part of the US. From the mid-19th century through the 1930s, the area was used as mining lands and for cattle grazing.To preserve North America's largest cactus, the area was proclaimed a National Monument on March 1, 1933, and signed into law by President Herbert Hoover. Over the next 61 years, Saguaro almost doubled in size, and in 1994 achieved National Park status."

Mount Whitney is probably the most famous peak in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon’s collection and one of the tallest mountains in the US, at 14,500 feet of elevation.;Mountains and canyons are mostly composed of granite, diorite, and monzonite which are 100 million years old igneous intrusive rocks. Yet, the Sierra Nevada Range is only 10 million years old and was formed when the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block tilted and uplifted under the influence of tectonic forces in the region of the Great Basin.;The impact of the glaciers is evident through the U-shaped valleys of Cedar Grove, Paradise Valley, and Tehipite Valley. Tehipite Dome, the biggest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, was also formed by glaciers. Although nothing is left of those ancient glaciers these days, it doesn’t mean there are no glaciers in the parks: they are found on the highest peaks and they are surprisingly rather young (~1,000 years old). However, they are melting swiftly and it is very likely they will soon disappear because of rising temperatures.;;HistoryThe area of the parks was originally populated by the Monache. They primarily occupied the vicinity of the Kaweah River (i.e., the Foothills region) but they also used the mountain passes as trade routes. European settlers brought with them diseases new to the Indigenous Peoples and as the result, their population shrank substantially in a short period of time. Another problem the Monache had to face was the loss of their lands as the settlers began actively using the natural resources of the area, the Giant Sequoia trees being one of them.;In 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established in an attempt to preserve the land and protect the trees from logging. Kings Canyon National Park was designated in 1940 largely because of (and thanks to!) John Muir’s activism. The two parks united in 1943 due to their closeness and similarities."

It loops around Mount Rainier, an impressive 14,411 ft active volcano, abruptly rising from the surrounding slopes. It is the highest point of the Cascade Range, and is extremely popular among climbers - there are about 10,000 yearly summit attempts, with approximately 50% actually making it to the top. The stratovolcano is surrounded by vast valleys, subalpine wildflower meadows, pure alpine lakes, and about 91,000 acres of an old-growth forest. Twenty-five major glaciers descend the flanks of the volcano, their meltwater creating numerous stunning waterfalls. Moreover, Mount Rainier is circled by the famous Wonderland Trail. Needless to say, photo opportunities abound.

A local anthropologist, Allan H. Smith, determined the five tribes that used this area: the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, Yakama, and Taidnapam (Upper Cowlitz).;Many different groups came together in the early 1890’s to lobby for the area’s protection and tourism potential.; Groups argued that the area wasn’t suitable for commercial ventures and needed to be preserved to allow for more thorough study and natural research.; After convincing congressmen that the park wouldn’t cost the government anything, Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899.The park is fascinating due to its geological features and elevations that span from just 1,600 ft. to over 14,000 ft. Mount Rainier (14,411 ft above the sea level) is the tallest mountain in Washington state, a stratovolcano carved by 25 named glaciers. It also sits on a subduction zone - here, the colliding continental and oceanic plates cause regular geothermal and seismic activity, as one of the plates is forced by another into the earth's mantle. Thus, small earthquakes regularly occur in the area, which makes Mount Rainier the second most seismically active volcano, after Mount St. Helens, in the northern Cascade Range.Moreover, more than 25 glaciers and countless snowfields cover Mount Rainier. They are crucial climatic change indicators that support five major river systems in this area and create numerous waterfalls that cascade down Mount Rainier's rugged slopes. Some of these waterfalls are fed by snowmelt only, which makes them ephemeral, so they appear only during certain times of the year. Other waterfalls are hidden deep in the park, and many hikers take the adventurous trails to where these treasures lay."

From some of the land of the Washington Forest Reserve, from the Skagit River to the Green River, the Snoqualmie National Forest was founded in 1908.; It remained an independent unit until 1973 when the two merged into the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.As for geological history, volcanic activity in the Cascades’ volcanoes was caused by the Juan de Fuca plate’s subduction off the western coast of North America.; North Cascades’ diverse rock formations made it a precious resource extraction area: copper, silver, and gold, along with molybdenum and tungsten mining, took place over the years.;Mt. Baker and Glacier Peak rise up thousands of feet above surrounding ridges. Both stratovolcanoes were formed roughly one million years ago within the Pleistocene epoch, but glacial erosion has eroded many of the earliest lava and tephra sediments. During this era, glaciation also gave rise to signature U-shaped valleys scattered throughout the forest. Mt. Baker, one of the youngest volcanoes in the Cascade Range, has a rich historical background. Northeast of the present volcano, pale-colored rock formations reflect the ancient Kulshan Caldera’s position, which collapsed one million years ago after an extensive ash eruption. Afterward, Mount Baker’s explosions have resulted in cones and lava flows of andesite, which forms many Cascade Range volcanoes.;Before Europeans came to the region, Mt. Baker was labeled as Koma Kulshan, meaning “Great White Watcher”. Though this is a popular climbing destination nowadays, climbing here requires loads of skills and efforts. The first man to climb Mount Baker was Edmund Thomas Coleman, a veteran of the Alps,; who managed to tame the volcano only after three attempts. "

Nowadays, they are one of eleven bands that make up the Pit River Tribe. The Pit River, the headwaters of the Burney Creek, was fundamental to the bands existence as it provided a source for fishing, gathering, as well as social and sacred activities. “Pit” denoted a traditional method of hunting when hunters dug deep holes to catch such large game as pronghorn, deer, and elk. Fur trappers started to move into the region in the 1820’s-30’s, and by the middle of the 1850’s, European and American immigrants already largely inhabited these lands. Unfortunately, the majority of the Ilmawi and the other bands died from European diseases or were forced to relocate to the Round Valley Reservation in Mendocino County.;John and Catherine McArthur, after whom the park is named, came to these lands in the 1860’s, acquired vast territories within the region, and opened a country store. Gradually, a few family farms and a little community of Peck’s Bridge appeared near the falls. When the recently established Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) started to purchase land and water rights in 1917, locals worrisomely anticipated the company would dam the river and destroy the falls in order to provide more hydroelectric power. However, John and Catherine McArthur’s children, Frank and Scott, bought the territory surrounding Burney Falls, thereby saving them. In 1920, they passed on their 160 acres to the State, asking only for the area to be named in honor of their parents. McArthur–Burney Falls Memorial State Park was officially established in 1926 and became the second park in the California State Park System.; As for the falls and the creek, they were named after a pioneer settler, Samuel Burney, who lived in the region in the 1850’s.;Geographically, the park is part of the Modoc Plateau and is similar to its eastern geomorphic lands. The basalt of Rocky Ledge formed about 200,000 years ago underlies a major part of the landscape and forms the lip of Burney Falls. Rocky Ledge is a lava stream covering over 25,000 acres east and north of the town of Burney. North of Burney Creek, diatomite forms notable white rock outcroppings. Interestingly, the diatomite is a sign that a freshwater lake and plankton called diatoms existed in the area over a million years ago."

The dunes were formed from the sand that was left behind after the lake disappeared.The human history of the area starts 11,000 years ago in the Stone Age, with the earliest Indigenous Peoples who used the land for hunting herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. In the Ute language, the Great Sand Dunes are called “saa waap maa nache,” which means ""sand that moves.""The first Europeans in Great Sand Dunes were Spanish hunters in the 17th century. When the gold and silver rush in Colorado occurred, the area near Great Sand Dunes was used for gold mining activity.

The mountains of the; Pacific Coast Ranges arose due to the accretion, or growth, of the terranes, which underwent significant metamorphism and were then covered with sedimentary and igneous rocks.HistoryThe name of the Rogue River National Forest refers to the Takelma tribe who were named ‘the Rogues’ by French-Canadian trappers after the first conflicts occurred between them. The area was designated by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 and had a different name - the Crater NF - until 1932.The Siskiyou National Forest was established in 1907 to replace the Siskiyou Forest Reserve and its designation happened during Roosevelt’s presidency as well. The Siskiyou National Forest draws its name from a Cree word that means ‘bob-tailed horse’.The Rogue River and Siskiyou National Forests were united to form the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in 2004."

a3dcd5b7-2eb9-49c4-9a1f-b0af6929e9aa;geologyAndHistory;"The Bridger-Teton National Forest partly derives its name from Jim Bridger, who was a famous hunter, mountain man, and guide.;While the first Euro-American fur trappers arrived in this region in 1807, there are over 800 archaeological sites that indicate over 10,000 years of human settlement. These people were largely nomadic hunter-gatherers who lived off of the bountiful flora and fauna found in this region.There is currently a couple of versions as to how the name of the Teton portion of the forest originated. The first one states it was named to indicate non-Lakota Sioux groups from Lakota Sioux groups. In addition, the Shoshone people called the range ""Teewinot,"" which translates to ""many pinnacles. The final and perhaps most;notorious story states that the North West Company organized an expedition to this region that resulted in the forest being named after a French-Canadian description of ""les trois tétons"" (Grand Teton (13,775 ft.), Middle Teton (12,804 ft.), and South Teton, 12,514 ft.). Translating to ""the three teats,"" it is evident what the French trappers were thinking of when they viewed these towering granite peaks.Today's the Bridger-Teton National Forest celebrates;""wildlife, wildlands, and wild vistas."" 2500 miles;of trails lead visitors to waterfalls, panoramic views, and protected wildernesses."

However, the terrain has not been formed just from below, but from above, too: for millennia mountains have been carved by glaciers. Now the Olympic Mountains are crowned with 184 glaciers.;For centuries the Olympic Peninsula was inhabited by Native American tribes: the Quileute, Makah, Lower Elwha Klallam, Quinault, Hoh, Skokomish, Jamestown S'Klallam, and Port Gamble S'Klallam. By the 19th century, European settlers began to appear and homestead the area, which, between the effort required to clear the land and the long, cold, and rainy winters, proved too difficult for many. ;Those who did stay became equally more concerned about deforestation and more interested in outdoor recreation. To protect this area, Olympic National Park was established in 1938."

Glacier Peak, at 10,544 feet, is a stratovolcano formed roughly one million years ago within the Pleistocene epoch. It is composed mainly of dacite, basalt, pumice, and ash.; After the most recent ice age, Glacier Peak seemed to wake up - it has produced at least five explosive eruptions in the past 3,000 years, including some of Washington state’s largest.;;Initially, Indigenous Tribes populating the area considered Glacier Peak not a volcano but a spirit. When European-Americans reached the area, they learned about the mountain but also didn’t recognize it as a volcano.; In the 1850s, only after tribe members told naturalist George Gibbs about the peak once smoking was Glacier Peak designated volcanic.; Not until 1898 was Glacier Peak finally documented on a published map.;"

The Los Padres National Forest has more endangered species than any other national forest in California, and many of them are fully dependent on the forest for survival.Among the animals that can be sighted in the area are California mule deer, coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, raccoons, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, and California black bears. The forest is also teeming with birdlife, allowing visitors a chance to spot California red-tailed hawks, barn owls, great horned owls, and other species - along with endangered American peregrine falcons and California condors. The Los Padres National Forest operates two condor sanctuaries as part of its California condor reintroduction effort. Visitors can watch these magnificent birds from the Condor Observation Site at the top of Mount Pinos.;The forest features a diverse mix of plant communities, with each ecosystem supporting its own unique blend of species. The chaparrals are represented by manzanita, true sages, chemise, and scrub oak and account for 68 percent of the area’s vegetation. Redwoods, Coulter pines, Douglas firs, sycamores, and various species of oak are also found here. Pinyon pines and junipers dominate the harsher climate of the Mt. Pinos Ranger District."

Sitting at 8,847 feet, Mount Pinos is the highest peak in the forest.;The wealth of mineral deposits found in the area includes gold, mercury, copper, uranium, zinc, chrome, and limestone. The Los Padres National Forest is also the only national forest in California with active commercial oil and gas development, which has been a source of controversy in recent years, as drilling takes place near some sensitive areas and could lead to the degradation of the forest’s fragile ecosystems.HistoryThe National Forest was created in 1898 as the Pine Mountain Forest Reserve, which was later combined with two other forest reserves and subsequently renamed the Santa Barbara National Forest. However, the new name did not appeal to local residents, as it was representative of only one county. In 1936, the forest changed its name yet again to honor the Spanish missionaries who evangelized around the area and became the Los Padres National Forest.;Of particular interest is the Chumash heritage of the National Forest lands. Found here are some of the most elaborate and extraordinary rock paintings in the world that were created by the Chumash Peoples. Before contact with Europeans, these Indigenous Peoples lived as hunter-gatherers in the resource-rich area between the Santa Ynez Range and the coast. The Chumash are thought to be one of the most advanced non-agricultural societies. They had a well-developed monetary system based on using shells and beads and an active trade. Many local features, such as Mount Pinos, held great spiritual significance to the Chumash Peoples."

The park offers great backpacking opportunities and features more than 90 miles of hiking trails, multiple campsites, and overwhelming natural scenery.Zion National Park offers 229 square miles of impressive wilderness that encompass four different habitat areas, including riparian, desert, pinyon-juniper woodland, and coniferous forest. The park is located in southwestern Utah, where the Colorado Plateau, Mojave Desert, and Great Basin converge. This area features spectacular terrain sculptured for millennia by water, wind, snow, volcanic activity, and seismic uplift. Epic cliffs, majestic canyons, picturesque waterfalls, grand rock formations, wide-open plateaus, and scenic woodlands are masterpieces of the art made by nature.The park’s real gem is Zion Canyon - an iconic gorge that is beyond beautiful. Carved by the Virgin River and wind over thousands of years, it reveals the sedimentary rock layers that can tell us about this area’s geological past.; Though Zion Canyon is far from the only attraction there, the park features plenty more natural wonders to behold: Kolob Canyons, Pine Creek, the Narrows, and the Temple of Sinawava are just a few points of interest worth visiting.Zion has an impressive historical background, too. The first people came to Zion about 10,000 years ago. It was inhabited by Ancestral Puebloan and Fremont peoples (~300 BCE to 1225 CE), then by the Southern Paiutes (1250 CE to present), and then by Mormon farmers who settled down in this area in the 19th century. Before being established as Zion National Park in 1919, the area was already known as Mukuntuweap National Monument, which had been dedicated in 1909.; Mukuntuweap is thought to mean ‘straight river’ or ‘straight canyon’ in the Southern Paiute language.; Then in 2009, about 80% of parklands were designated as Zion Wilderness by President Barack Obama.; The ‘wilderness’ label adds another level of protection to the land and ensures future generations access to this beautiful place!"

If you're interested in more geological facts about the area, consider checking out the Geologic Map of the San Gorgonio Mountain Quadrangle and San Gorgonio Wilderness Association's Geology, Flora and Fauna page.Cahuilla Tribes, who along with Serrano Tribes were the first to inhabit the area, considered San Gorgonio Mountain sacred. The main activities of Indigenous Tribes were gathering and hunting in the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains.;After 1771, the lands were claimed by the Spanish, and the tribes revolted against them. However, in 1834 the Mexican Alta Government removed many Serrano people to missions where they suffered from smallpox outbreaks. Tragically in 1867, some bands of Serrano were also mistakenly held responsible for a raid on an American settlement and endured a long, violent campaign against them.; The survivors, led by Santos Manuel, moved from the mountains to present-day Highland, CA.;In 1891 the San Manuel Reservation, named for Santos Manuel, was established for the tribes.The San Gorgonio Wilderness itself was one of the first designated wildernesses in the United States - the United States Congress signed it into law in 1964.

They were members of the preliminary survey party, ‘Road Viewers’, and intended to explore the area where the future Free Emigrant Road was going to be built. To travel the new road, which was finished in 1853, emigrants did not have to pay any tolls, as opposed to the routes established earlier, such as through the mouth of the Deschutes River and the Barlow Road."

These are the products of numerous geological processes that have taken place over millions of years and are still occurring today. The granitic rock that provided the raw material for these natural creations originated over 100 million years ago. A collision of tectonic plates forced pockets of molten lava to move upwards and harden, creating a system of monzogranitic rock structures buried under the earth’s surface. Persistent groundwater erosion has shaped and polished these rocks over time. More recently, the increasingly dry climate of the area brought on arid winds and flash floods that gradually removed the top layer of the soil, revealing the magnificent formations we see today.HistoryOriginally established as a protected area in 1936, Joshua Tree National Park received its national park status in 1994 pursuant to the California Desert Protection Act. Despite its dry climate and seemingly barren terrain, the territory has attracted many settlers, gold miners, cattle ranchers, artists, and conservationists over the years.;Initially seen by some early explorers as desolate and unlivable terrain, the desert sustained the livelihoods of several Indigenous Tribes, including the Serrano, Chemehuevi, and Cahuilla Peoples. These were some of the first known inhabitants of the area — hunter-gatherers who skillfully used the land’s limited resources for food, medicine, tools, and weapons. The Serrano Peoples in particular are known as the founders of the Oasis of Mara, which is now the town of Twentynine Palms. They successfully cultivated the land of the oasis up until the beginning of the 20th century, when the influx of gold miners and ranchers put the area’s water sources under strain and largely displaced the Indigenous population. The remains of some of the gold and silver mines of that period, such as the Lost Horse Mine and the Desert Queen Mine, can still be found around the park."

b9485d29-520b-4c71-8278-4ed59d1cccb3;geologyAndHistory;"Bryce Canyon National Park is famous for its geologic features. Millions of visitors come to the park to appreciate the beauty of the largest collection of “hoodoos” in the world. This impressive and colorful scenery has been formed by erosion. Nowadays, these exposed freshwater limestone features can be seen along and below the Paunsaugunt Plateau’s rim. The bizarre forms are the result of water erosion, freeze-thaw cycles, and chemical weathering. Most of this process took place during the Tertiary period. To learn more about Bryce Canyon National Park’s fascinating geologic features, follow this link.;Indiginous Peoples were here at least 10,000 years ago. Most of them were just passing the canyon by, as this place was not the best for settling, yet Paleo-Americans used to hunt huge mammals here at the end of the Ice Age. Later, the plateau was visited while harvesting pine nuts and conducting rabbit drives - broad-scale rabbit hunts.Bryce Canyon National Park eventually got its status in 1928. The park was named after Ebenezer Bryce, a carpenter from Scotland who was sent to the Paria River by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1875. Ebenezer's home was built near the canyon, so the locals called it ""Bryce's Canyon."""

It loops around Mount Rainier, an impressive 14,411 ft active volcano, abruptly rising from the surrounding slopes. It is the highest point of the Cascade Range, and is extremely popular among climbers - there are about 10,000 yearly summit attempts, with approximately 50% actually making it to the top. The stratovolcano is surrounded by vast valleys, subalpine wildflower meadows, pure alpine lakes, and about 91,000 acres of an old-growth forest. Twenty-five major glaciers descend the flanks of the volcano, their meltwater creating numerous stunning waterfalls. Moreover, Mount Rainier is circled by the famous Wonderland Trail. Needless to say, photo opportunities abound.
b9ca5a45-284d-4a9a-a264-d89273749333;wildlifeInfo;"The area has excellent wildlife due to its long protected status, and includes cougar, black bear, raccoon, coyote, snowshoe hare, bobcat, weasel, mole, beaver, red fox, porcupine, skunk, deer, elk, mountain goat… you name it!; As for the birds, there is an abundance of them: the thrush, chickadee, kinglet, northern goshawk, willow flycatcher, and spotted owl (for at least part of the year) all call the park home.Flora is different in each of the three zones - there are ancient forest, subalpine, and alpine zones in the park. Forest covers about 58% of the park, with Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar at low elevations. At middle elevations, western white pine, Pacific silver fir, noble fir, and Alaska yellow cedar dominate. High elevation forests feature Alaskan yellow cedar, mountain hemlock, and subalpine fir. As the territory becomes drier, Whitebark pine and Engelmann spruce start to stand out.;The subalpine zone takes up about 23% of the park and comprises less dense forests and lush blooming subalpine meadows. They encircle Mount Rainier at elevations from 5,000 ft to approximately 7,000 ft. The meadows stay under snow well into the month of June if not later, so the wildflowers manage to bloom in a short growing season.;The alpine zone is present from about 7,000 ft until reaching the mountain's summit. Approximately 50% of that land is covered by snow and ice. Alpine vegetation includes some small groups of plants, such as sedges, penstemons, and asters, that manage to grow on one of the four alpine growing areas: talus slopes, snow beds, fell fields, and heather communities.;Also, there are over 500 different species of lichen in Mount Rainier National Park!"
b9ca5a45-284d-4a9a-a264-d89273749333;geologyAndHistory;"Based on found evidence, archaeologists estimate that the area around the mountain was most heavily used by Indigenous Tribes between 8,000 and 4,500 years ago.; It is also assumed that Columbia Plateau Tribes lived in this area from about 1000 to 300 years ago - scientists found hunting artifacts in a rock shelter near Fryingpan Creek, east of Goat Island Mountain.; The park's lands were primarily used for hunting and gathering and, occasionally, spirit quests. A local anthropologist, Allan H. Smith, determined the five tribes that used this area: the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, Yakama, and Taidnapam (Upper Cowlitz).;Many different groups came together in the early 1890’s to lobby for the area’s protection and tourism potential.; Groups argued that the area wasn’t suitable for commercial ventures and needed to be preserved to allow for more thorough study and natural research.; After convincing congressmen that the park wouldn’t cost the government anything, Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899.The park is fascinating due to its geological features and elevations that span from just 1,600 ft. to over 14,000 ft. Mount Rainier (14,411 ft above the sea level) is the tallest mountain in Washington state, a stratovolcano carved by 25 named glaciers. It also sits on a subduction zone - here, the colliding continental and oceanic plates cause regular geothermal and seismic activity, as one of the plates is forced by another into the earth's mantle. Thus, small earthquakes regularly occur in the area, which makes Mount Rainier the second most seismically active volcano, after Mount St. Helens, in the northern Cascade Range.Moreover, more than 25 glaciers and countless snowfields cover Mount Rainier. They are crucial climatic change indicators that support five major river systems in this area and create numerous waterfalls that cascade down Mount Rainier's rugged slopes. Some of these waterfalls are fed by snowmelt only, which makes them ephemeral, so they appear only during certain times of the year. Other waterfalls are hidden deep in the park, and many hikers take the adventurous trails to where these treasures lay."

bda8a85d-8c03-4543-91f8-bc019fde6096;geologyAndHistory;"Geology;As the territory of the Forest covers a portion of the central Sierra Nevada, the geology of the Stanislaus NF can be viewed in the context of Sierra Nevada geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today.HistoryPeople have populated the Stanislaus National Forest region for an amazingly long period of time. One of the ancient dwellings discovered in the area is 9,500 years old, and archaeologists consider it the oldest dwelling construction in North America.Later the area became inhabited by the Me-Wuk, who used the lands for hunting, foraging, and occasional farming. They predominantly occupied the California Central Valley but frequented the Sierra Nevada during the summer, traveling along the Stanislaus River. Their community was organized into groups of 100-500 people who lived in isolated villages.At the beginning of the 19th century, the first Europeans arrived in the area. The Spanish were pioneers as they came here as part of Gabriel Moraga’s expedition in 1806. They were soon followed by Americans with a major interest in furs. The California Gold Rush in the middle of the century attracted even more newcomers to these lands, and they started actively using them for mining. Once the local gold sources dried up, the prospectors left the place, and it became less frequented by visitors.The Stanislaus National Forest, established in 1897, is one of the oldest National Forests."

Elevations vary between 2,000 feet in the Feather River Canyon to 7,017 feet at Spanish Peak.;It might be hard to believe, but the area now known as the Sierra Nevada was once underwater. A complex geologic process that involved tectonic plates movement, volcanic activity, erosion, and an impact by meteorological conditions created the range that extends for 400 miles in California and Nevada and falls partially within the Bucks Lake Wilderness. When the mountains formed, glacial activity intervened and carved out canyons, stream channels, and valleys. The mountains of Sierra Nevada continue to change due to the shifting of tectonic plates.HistoryEstablished in 1984, the Bucks Lake Wilderness owes its name to Horace Bucklin, who was one of the first immigrants to settle in the Bucks Valley after he left New York in 1850.In 1929, Bucks Dam was built for electricity production purposes by the Feather River Power Company but eventually changed hands to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the current owner.

In an effort to protect the remaining wilderness, environmental activists emboldened their decades-long campaign that finally resulted in the establishment of the North Cascades National Park on October 2, 1968.; North Cascades Highway was completed in 1972 and is the first and, still only, paved road that traverses the entire park.; The fact that it is closed for much of the year due to snow and avalanche danger makes the North Cascades one of the most remote and least visited National Parks.As for geologic history, the North Cascades are one of the most complex and least understood mountain ranges in the US.; A theory exists that a hundred million years ago, a collision of a separate micro-continent in the Pacific Ocean formed a mountain range off the western shore of North America. These mountains were moved by oceanic plates that eventually collided with the continent, faulted, and were thrust further upward.; Gradually, erosion and further faulting, almost leveled the mountains.; Around 40 million years ago, heavy oceanic rock pushed beneath the area and, coupled with volcanic eruptions, pushed the mountains higher once again.; Further faulting pushed the peaks even taller and exposed the granitic and metamorphic roots of the ancient mountains.; About five or six million years ago, the volcanic activity in the area started moving southeast and the North Cascades have remained relatively the same as the shape we can currently see."
c59b0dd0-bd53-40bd-9ac2-10f0b2ad735b;description;"Located in Washington, the North Cascades National Park Complex consists of three units: North Cascades National Park, the Ross Lake National Recreation Area and the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Almost the entire territory of the complex is also considered the Stephen Mather Wilderness, which gives the area the highest protection status available for federally managed areas.  The Skagit River is commonly used as a dividing line - breaking North Cascades National Park Complex into northern and southern sections.;People call the complex ‘The American Alps’ for its snow-covered peaks towering over dense virgin forests and subalpine meadows; which is very reminiscent of the European Alps. The real name, though - North Cascades - comes from the area’s location within the broader Cascade Range that stretches from British Columbia to California and features massive volcanic peaks and countless waterfalls. More than 300 glaciers crown the mountains of the North Cascades, making it the most glaciated area in the contiguous United States.Explore the local trails on foot, or by horse. Choose to take it easy with a scenic drive or push your limits with the area’s countless mountaineering routes. Whatever you decide - a trip to the North Cascades will be an unforgettable experience."

President Theodore Roosevelt established the range in 1908, taking land from the Flathead Reservation and its Tribes to do so. Until December 2020, it operated as a National Wildlife Refuge. And in 2021, the range lands were returned to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) who now oversee all conservation efforts.The Range supports and protects a population of American bison, along with other animals like bighorn sheep, coyotes, white-tail and mule deer, elk, pronghorn antelope, and ground squirrels. Many interesting bird species call the area home, including bluebirds, ducks, eagles, geese, hawks, and meadowlarks. Nearby recreational areas include Ninepipe and Pablo National Wildlife Refuges.Fishing in the CSKT Bison Range is allowed at designated fishing sites along specific portions of Mission Creek. You can learn more about recreational opportunities at the Bison Range Visitor Center.

The wilderness owes its name to California's colorful State Fish, which is native solely to the creeks and rivers flowing in the area.;With hundreds of hiking trails, two gorgeous rivers, the North and South Forks of the Kern River, excellent horseback riding, swimming, and fishing opportunities, the Golden Trout Wilderness attracts quite a few visitors. Numerous highlights include the Pacific Crest Trail winding through the area, Kern Peak with its grand panorama, and Cottonwood Pass that features astounding views of the peaks and ridges surrounding Horseshoe Meadow, the Inyo Mountains, and the Great Western Divide."
c5e98a76-caa3-486a-8660-777eb7992122;geologyAndHistory;"The Paiute and Shoshone tribes used this area in summer for hunting and food gathering. While most of them were moved to reservations, some of them still live on their native land on the eastern side of the Kern Plateau.;Mining was never a primary activity in the wilderness, but gold, lead, tungsten, and molybdenum are known to be in the area. As the Golden Trout is a part of the Sierra Nevada, it makes sense to have a closer look at the range's geology. The beginning of the Sierra Nevada geological history is associated with the Triassic period and the formation of the area’s earliest granite. During the ‘Nevadan Orogeny’ metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise, and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes.;The Golden Trout Wilderness was granted its wilderness status in 1978 and is managed by the US Forest Service’s Sequoia National Forest and Inyo National Forest agencies."

During the ‘Nevadan Orogeny’ metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise, and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake that took place in 1872.;Yosemite's granite has always been massive, durable, and mostly non-layered, otherwise the valleys' cliffs and numerous high peaks wouldn't have been able to rise. Despite this single layer, the Yosemite granite is not monolithic (one solid rock) and is composed of numerous smaller bodies of granitic rock, fostering a huge variety of granite in the mountains. Metamorphic rocks also dot the area, mostly in the western foothills, but they are scarce and occupy less than 5% of the park.;The park is home to two glaciers: the Lyell Glacier and Maclure Glacier. They are of paramount importance as the glaciers provide a cold water supply to the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River and the surrounding ecosystems. The Lyell Glacier sits just below Mount Lyell, the highest point of the park (topping out at 13,114 feet). For more information on Yosemite NP's geology, please visit the NPS' Geology page."

Proceeding from the southern end of the area near the Cherry Reservoir to Leavitt Peak just next to the northern boundary, elevations rise dramatically from 5,000 feet to 11,750 feet.;As the territory of the Wilderness covers a portion of the central Sierra Nevada, its geology can be viewed in the context of Sierra Nevada’s geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today.HistoryPeople have populated the Emigrant Wilderness region for an amazingly long (estimated 10,000 years!) period of time.;The area was inhabited by the Me-Wuk Tribe, who used the lands for hunting, foraging, and occasional farming. They predominantly occupied the California Central Valley but frequented the Sierra Nevada during the summer, traveling along the Stanislaus River. Their community was organized into groups of 100-500 people who lived in isolated villages.The California Gold Rush in the middle of the 19th century attracted newcomers to these lands, and they started actively using them for mining. Unfortunately, the new settlers also brought disease which, coupled with violent confrontations, led to a quick decline of the indigenous population.;In 1852 the Clark Skidmore Party, one of the emigrant groups in California, established a new route called the West Walker (sometimes referred to as Sonora Pass Trail). It crossed the Sierra over Emigrant Pass (or Emigrant Gap) with the path moving through today’s Emigrant Wilderness. However, the party eventually abandoned the route soon due to its challenging terrain.;The Forest Service first designated the Emigrant Basin Primitive Area in 1931.;Later, in 1975, the area was redesignated the Emigrant Wilderness by Congress."

c7f9b3c4-3955-4432-9d63-e508cd0726a8;geologyAndHistory;"The Washoe and Nisenan Tribes have used the lands of the Tahoe National Forest for thousands of years. The region was not considered conducive to settlement by the Spanish, Mexicans, or Americans until 1848 when John Marshall discovered gold on the South Fork of the American River. The Gold Rush brought a large influx of gold seekers and prospectors into these heretofore overlooked lands. Many nearby towns, including Foresthill, Nevada City, Downieville, and Sierra City, developed during the Gold Rush period. The Nisenan living within the Tahoe in those days experienced the largest impact from disease, resource depletion, and violence - their population fell from 9,000 to just 2,500 in just a few decades. Despite the odds, the Nisenan Tribe survived and have gone into agriculture, logging, ranching, and domestic activities. To learn more about the Nisenan, please visit their website.Thousands of migrants have traveled by foot through the Tahoe NF and its routes until the first transcontinental railroad was built in the late 1860’s to link the coasts of the US and provide shipping for gold and agricultural products. This railroad is a notable engineering achievement, with its track completed by tunneling through granite peaks, bridging deep gorges and rivers, and routing it through numerous snowy passes.Mining, ranching, and logging were left unchecked and got out of control - this led to the Tahoe falling under federal management in 1893 as the Forest Reserves. The area was first designated as the Lake Tahoe Forest Reserve and later, in 1905, received its present name - the Tahoe National Forest.;In terms of geology, the Tahoe NF sprawls within the Sierra Nevada range. Among the natural forces that shaped the area are massive sedimentation and erosion, volcanism and seismic upheaval, both gradual and violent, and the slow power of glaciation.;"

cbb3ec31-f275-46eb-9641-d17d27e8bae8;geologyAndHistory;"Death Valley is a valley with steep slopes situated between the Death Valley and Furnace Creek strike-slip fault lines. The location used to be a warm, shallow sea during the Paleozoic Era (542-251 million years ago) but during the next geologic era, the Mesozoic (251 million-65.5 million years ago), this shallow sea receded as a result of plate tectonics.;The next 60 million years was a time of significant mountain building and the movement of plate tectonics along the various fault lines in the region, resulting in the formation of volcanoes from Furnace Creek near the center of the park to Shoshone on its southeastern border. The eruptions of these volcanoes over time have provided the region with both its rich mineral deposits and its beautiful and vivid rainbow of colors which can be seen just south of Furnace Creek at Artist’s Palette.;Most recently, geologically speaking, the tectonic plate activity began to change. While the region was once one of compressive forces that led to mountain building and the rise of volcanoes, recent geologic times has the region under the forces of plates that are pulling apart from one another, forming the deepest, hottest, and driest valley in the United States today, which we know as Death Valley.;Today, the area is known to contain plenty of salt deposits, the remnants of lakes that have disappeared as the result of climate change following the end of the Earth’s last ice age.;"
cc2b3991-bc8c-4922-892a-504d70e06906;geologyAndHistory;"Glacier National Park traces its geologic history back to over 1.6 billion years ago when the Belt Sea still covered the park, as well as the entirety of the American Northwest. Sediments from higher elevations would float to the sea bottom, accumulate, and condense to form rock layers. Traces of the sea can still be seen in the rock layers and ripple marks throughout the park. Sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks dominate the park, and the sedimentary rocks are considered to be among the oldest in North America. What is more surprising is their good condition, as it’s uncommon for sedimentary rocks to be well preserved.;Later, over 750 million years ago, igneous rock flowed into the Belt Sea after disturbances in the earth’s crust.;It is now evident as sills (magma that flows into a fracture) in the region's limestone layers.Around 300 million years ago, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains formed during a period of uplift. Consisting of mostly metamorphic rock, the mountains eroded back to sediment in the coming Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. The Larimide Orogeny (a period of mountain building) caused most of the current Rocky Mountains to be built between 55 and 80 million years ago, with events continuing until about 2.6 million years ago. It resulted in the Lewis Thrust Fault - a notable geological feature that Glacier National Park is famous for.;The fault is visible in many of the park's mountains and is a phenomenal example of a Thrust Fault, or Overthrust - when a layer of older rock is thrust over a layer of younger rock. The park's rock layers are also notable for their distinct red and green layers that can be seen banded together. The two main factors behind this process are iron and oxygenl when rocks with a high iron content are formed while exposed to oxygen, they turn red and orange and when no oxygen is present, they stay green.;The Rockies, and much of the United States, was subject to multiple Ice Ages, or periods of glaciation, from around 2 million to about 11,000 year ago. The glaciers played a huge part in creating the mountains, valleys, and moraines present today. Glacial carving also formed the cirques that host many of the park's lakes. Lake McDonald Valley’s unique shape is an example of this process.When it comes to human history, the first people to inhabit the area were Indigenous Tribes who have lived in this around since around 10,000 years ago. During this time, the Blackfeet Tribe gained control of the plains on the east side of the mountains, including its extensive prairies and vast bison population. The Blackfeet were pushed further west by European-American's western advancement. Generally nomadic, they used dogs to pull their travois (sleds) from place to place until horses were introduced.The Kootenai, Upper Pend d’Oreille, and Bitterroot Salish Tribes territory once extended from the forests and valley on the west side of the mountains across the mountain range crest and into the plains on the east side. When the Blackfeet acquired horses, they began to expand their territory and pushed many of these tribes off of the plains, though the western tribes would still often traverse through the mountains, hunting both game and buffalo on the eastern plains.Europeans started to explore the area in the early 1700’s looking for beavers to trap, then minerals and land to settle. The Lewis and Clark expedition were among the first to visit the area. The new European settlers were originally welcomed by tribes in the area, but the sentiment quickly changed as smallpox began ravaging the Indigenous communities.;The disease, alongside tremendous resource depletion and increasing violence, forced the tribes to sign treaties and relocate onto reservations.;Today, the Blackfeet Nation Reservation and the Flathead Reservation are respectively located to the east and southwest of Glacier National Park, and the robust culture and community of these tribes persevere.Probably one of the most important individuals who played a role in shaping the park’s history was George Bird Grinnell, a well-respected explorer. In 1885, he was deeply impressed by the area’s landscapes and was determined to establish a national park. It was he who referred to the region as the ‘Crown of the Continent’.Another factor leading to the area’s current status was the construction of the Great Northern Railway in 1891. In order to attract more passengers, the beauty of the region was advertised to the public as a vacation destination. In 1897, the US Congress designated the area as a forest preserve and later, in 1910, a national park.The Great Northern Railway sold Glacier as “America’s Switzerland” by building Swiss-style hotels and chalets. As automobiles became more widespread, work on Going-to-the-Sun Road began. After 11 years, the road opened to the public in 1932. Traversing through the heart of the park from the West Glacier entrance to the eastern St. Mary entrance, the road drives through an absolutely astounding landscape of deep valleys and massive mountains. The road has earned quite a few honors for its construction and scenic nature. It is designated as a National Historic Landmark and, for all the trivia buffs out there, it appeared at the beginning of the movie The Shining.;"

Interestingly, due to the merging of several different ecosystems (alpine, prairie, even coastal), the park features animals and plants that are generally not found together within one region.The park supports a variety of wildlife, including hoary marmot, snowshoe hare, Columbian ground squirrel, beaver, elk, bighorn sheep, and the park's mountain goats who are so widespread and easily spotted that they have become the symbol of Glacier National Park.The park is also very well known for it's large grizzly and black bear populations. They are an absolute sight to see in the wild and certainly make Glacier a special place - it's one of only 5 areas in the lower 48 where grizzly bears can be found.  To avoid conflict, appreciate wildlife from a distance and do not disturb animals. Please note that proper food and scented storage is required day and night to keep both visitors and bears safe.  Carrying and knowing how to use bear spray properly is advised, and a must if you plan to venture onto the parks backcountry hiking trails.  Please see the park's Bear Safety page for more.Birdwatching is rather enjoyable here as well - look for bald and golden eagles, Northern Hawk Owls, ospreys, swifts, and harlequins.The lakes and streams are teeming with brook trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout, kokanee, largescale suckers, northern pikeminnow, and redside shiners.In 1995, Glacier National Park was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The main reason being for the thriving and diverse wildlife population that has not significantly changed since the area's discovery. The park is home to 71 species of mammals, 1132 species of plants (at least!), nearly 300 species of birds, and 21 types of fish.For more information on the park's flora and fauna, please visit its Nature &amp; Science page."

Featuring one of the most outstanding mountain landscapes in the United States, the park sprawls across one million acres and over 700 miles of trails offer visitors an array of exceptional natural wonders to enjoy.Located in northwestern Montana, Glacier National Park sits astride the US-Canada border and, along with Canada’s Waterton Lakes National Park, comprises the Glacier-Waterton International Peace Park. Behind this unity is the decision to share the responsibilities of maintaining the upper Waterton Valley that sprawls between the countries. Since 1932, the two parks have been working together to take care of the incredible wilderness.As one of the most photographed national parks, Glacier is home to more than 150 peaks over 8,000 ft., 762 gorgeous lakes, 2,865 miles of streams, and countless stunning waterfalls. As of 2015, there were 26 named glaciers remaining. The park's peaks are part of two sub-ranges of the Rocky Mountains, the Livingston Range, and the Lewis &amp; Clark Range. Mount Cleveland, standing at an elevation of 10,466 ft., is the highest peak in the National Park and the Lewis &amp; Clark Range. Among other popular landmarks are Lake McDonald, the largest lake in the park, and the striking U-shaped valley that hugs it.The park's name comes from the abundance of glaciers in the area. The Kootenai referred to Glacier National Park as Ya·qawiswit̓xuki, meaning ""the place where there is a lot of ice."" In 1850, the park was home to 80-150 glaciers, but the number has decreased dramatically to the 26 named glaciers visitors can see today. The park's most prominent glacier, Harrison Glacier, is estimated to cover an area of around 410 acres.Glacier National Park offers dozens of recreational opportunities, including scenic drives, fly-fishing, boating, climbing, and many more.

ccd4d1ce-6e98-448e-8b25-551f1fcdc31e;geologyAndHistory;"GeologyMount Adams is a stratovolcano that emerged during the second half of the Pleistocene Era, after a series of cycles when lava-extruding eruptions were followed by extended stages of dormancy and minor activity. There were three such cycles, and when the eruptions occurred, mostly lava flows with little tephra (rock fragments) came out, forming the volcano. During the ‘calm’ periods, the mountain, affected by glaciers, was reduced in height before being built up again.;When glaciers covered the volcano during the last Ice Age, the current, main cone was formed. As the lava erupted and reached the ice, it cooled incredibly quickly and broke into small pieces, forming the cone interior that consists of andesite fragments. Regular discharges of heat and caustic gases over time has caused much of the rock to transform into clays, iron oxides, sulfur-rich compounds, and quartz.Mount Adams is considered to be a dormant volcano and not extinct, but the level of seismic activity in its vicinity is so low that it falls into the category of the quietest volcanoes in Oregon and Washington.HistoryThe Indigenous Peoples who lived in the vicinity of Mount Adams called it two different names: Pahto and Klickitat. In Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, and Salishan languages ​​, Pahto means ‘very high.’ While the name Klickitat is a different Chinookan word that means ‘beyond’ and was a reference to the Rocky Mountains and also was their name for the Klickitat tribe, who refer to themselves as the Qwû'lh-hwai-pûm.Although the European explorers encountered Mount Adams for the first time in 1805, during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, it was confused with Mount St. Helens for decades due to their resemblance in shape (at the time) and similar latitude.; It received its English name in the 1830’s. Andrew Glenn Aiken, Edward Jay Allen, and Andrew J. Burge were the first to climb Mount Adams in 1854 as part of their mission to improve a new military road.Several caves found around the mountain were used for various commercial purposes, such as ice mining, potato, and cheese storage.In 1915, Mount Adams was filmed for a documentary ‘When the Mountains Call.’"

The complex geologic process that involved tectonic plate movement, volcanic activity, erosion, and the impact of meteorological conditions created the range that extends for 400 miles in California and Nevada and falls partially within the Plumas National Forest. When the mountains formed, glacial activity then intervened and carved out canyons, stream channels, and valleys. The mountains of the Sierra Nevada continue to change due to the shifting of tectonic plates.HistoryThe human history of the Plumas National Forest extends back as far as 8,000 years ago. The earliest known residents of this land were the Indigenous Tribes of Maidu, Paiute, and Washoe peoples. The rough local terrain turned off most potential European visitors to the area up until the middle of the 19th century. Though, the Hudson Bay Fur Company ventured into the area as part of their mission to explore and develop Northern California in the 1830’s.;;In the 1850’s, prospectors streamed into Plumas with the beginning of the California Gold Rush, and gold camps mushroomed throughout the area. Fun fact: miners used to entertain themselves by skiing - they created a prototype of present-day skis (12-14 foot boards) and even held competitions, the first skiing competitions in the world!With the development of mining camps, supporting industries like timber and agriculture grew as well, and later they became (and still remain) the backbone of the local economy.

Basalt lava is characterized by significantly higher temperatures than other lava types and therefore it spreads out faster as well. Moving down the valley it eventually reached some natural dam, presumably a glacial moraine and began to accumulate behind it, thus forming a lava lake that reached 400 feet in depth in some areas.When the lava flow halted, the molten rock began to solidify and for shallow areas it took much less time than for deeper parts. During this process, the lava lake was gradually shrinking, as solid basalt’s volume is less than that of its liquid form. At this stage, cracks, or joints, were formed. Internal tension caused by cooling and contraction is relieved by jointing. In fact, jointing is the main architect who created the amazing Devils Postpile columns.The Devils Postpile used to be considerably higher than it is now. Over the last 80,000 to 100,000 years, it has been eroding under the impact of earthquakes, water, and glaciers. The last glaciation which took place around 15,000 years ago is evident through the glacial polish and striations visible on top of the Postpile.HistoryDevils Postpile National Monument used to be part of Yosemite National Park but as gold was found near Mammoth Lakes in 1905, boundaries shifted and it became a separate unit. The monument was nearly destroyed for the sake of building a hydroelectric dam, but thanks to some Californians’ activism it did not happen. The area was designated a National Monument by President William Howard Taft in 1911, in order to protect it from demolition.

The first attempt to get this impact under control was made by President Grover Cleveland who established the San Jacinto Forest Reserve in 1897. As the State Park, Mount San Jacinto began operating in 1937.GeologyThe main characters of the geological history of the Park are no doubt the San Jacinto Mountains. As a result of the complex subduction process when the oceanic Pacific Plate slid under the edge of the continental North American Plate, the mountains and volcanoes of Southern California were formed. The friction caused by the subduction melted the rock and created magma. As it climbs to the earth surface, magma gradually cools down and gets solidified. When magma pools, cools, and solidifies in one area, a batholith come from is formed - it takes millions of years for this to happen. A Mesozoic granite batholith lies in the heart of the rock mass of the San Jacinto Mountains and its fragments are currently visible at higher elevations due to the erosion of the rock previously covering it.;"

One can find physically-demanding recreational activities such as surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and bouldering. Others can park their RV and set up camp at a designated campsite for a quiet escape from the city. No matter what your ideal getaway may be, King Range Wilderness can guarantee respite, as the area’s geography is too rugged even for highways.In addition to its 42,694 acres of secluded wilderness, King Range Wilderness runs 35 miles along the California coast, making it the longest undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States of America. It is due to its proximity to the cold ocean water of the Pacific that temperatures here average out to about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But that is not the only role the ocean plays in defining this wilderness area. In fact, the unique geography of King Range Wilderness makes it a special place to visit, as this designated wilderness area is where rugged, forested mountains and sheer cliffs meet the ocean! That the ocean here is usually covered by fog, leaving only peaks visible from the summit of King Peak some 4,000 feet above sea level, explains how the coastline came to be known as Lost Coast.Now, many people think Seattle is the rainiest place in the country but almost three times as much rain falls in King Range Wilderness on an annual basis than does in that Emerald City some 700 miles further north along the coast. Thus, King Range Wilderness is one of the wettest places in the country, and the wettest place in California thanks to the area’s extreme topographical relief which causes massive amounts of orographic rainfall.It is to this rainfall that King Range Wilderness owes its spectacular biological and botanical diversity. In addition to supporting undisturbed, ancient Douglas fir and oak forests, King Range Wilderness is home to some 250 endangered species, as well as some iconic residents like the bald eagle and at least 300 other native and migratory birds, making King Range Wilderness a paradise for ornithologists and bird watchers alike. The area is also home to a plethora of marine animals such as seals, sea lions, otters, and migratory fish. Land animals such as elk, black-tailed deer, mountain lions, black bears, as well as other wildlife, also inhabit these parts. If King Range Wilderness were a group of islands, it might as well be the Galapagos Islands of North America.That is not to say that the area has never been settled. The lands that are now King Range Wilderness were inhabited by Indigenous Peoples as early as 1100 AD, and visited by explorers from Spain, Russia, and the United States as early as the 16th Century. The earliest known prehistoric sites are no older than about 2,800 years old, something experts attribute to natural processes like erosion and tectonic activity.;Regardless, King Range Wilderness is a highly secluded area. A visit to this wilderness will provide the seclusion and serenity you seek as you traverse its 80 miles of hiking trails. Though with this natural beauty and seclusion comes danger. Visitors are advised that many parts of Lost Coast Trail are impassable during times of high tide and are advised to take caution even during times of low tide. The good news is that tides are predictable and you can plan your hike accordingly.While a permit is not required for day-use access to King Range Wilderness, anyone planning to stay overnight will need a wilderness permit which can be obtained online at Recreation.gov. Foraging also requires a permit, a separate collection permit. This includes foraging for the much-sought-after matsutake mushrooms, which grow under tan oaks. "

In addition to the Dougas-fir forests, King Range Wilderness is home to the epic coastal redwood, which are among the tallest and oldest living things on Earth, the Knobcone pine tree, which grows from Baja California through Oregon, and the California laurel, also known as the balm of heaven.;Pacific madrone trees, which produce edible, yet mostly tasteless red berries in the fall, and tanoak, which produces very bitter nut kernels that are inedible to humans, are also part of the natural vegetation of King Range Wilderness. Also found in the King Range Wilderness is beargrass, a perennial herb that can grow up to 60 inches tall and was historically used by native peoples to weave baskets, giving it the Indian basket grass nickname.King Range Wilderness is also well known for its several varieties of mushrooms including a mushroom similar to matsutake, which grows in the shade under tanoak. Paradoxically, American matsutake mushrooms take their name from Japanese, where matsu means pine tree and take means mushroom. These mushrooms are considered by many to be a luxurious ingredient and are known for their spicy aroma.;For those interested in collecting mushrooms at King Range for personal use (non-commercial), the month of December is usually the time to go and there are daily harvesting limits of five pounds. Additionally, the mushrooms must be cut in a way to remove their commercial value. Commercial harvesting requires a permit from the Bureau of Land Management.King Range is also home to a diverse range of fauna. Specifically, this area is inhabited by black-tailed deer, black bears (don’t forget your bear canister!), mountain lions, gray foxes, and Roosevelt elk, the largest of four surviving subspecies of elk. Please be cautious around elk herds, especially when hiking during their mating season from August through October.Land animals in King Range Wilderness are kept company by a wide variety of birds, including quails, doves, hawks, turkey vultures, pelicans, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, owls, and osprey. Meanwhile, visitors to King Range Wilderness can spot a wide variety of marine animals, including harbor seals, sea lions, and river otters. Don’t mistake the river otters playing on the shore for sea otters, though, there are no sea otters in this area.;Also, sea lions and harbor seals live along the shoreline and like to rest on the offshore rocks. If you would like to see baby seals, we recommend visiting King Range in March or April, during which time you may also be able to spot some migrating Grey whales near the Lost Coast shore. Their migration route has them passing by from December through May. By the way, let’s not forget about baby sea lions! If that is something interesting to you, plan your trip for the summer months of June and July.;Lastly, a note about endangered species. King Range Wilderness is home to four federally endangered species, namely, the Coho Salmon, Chinook Salmon, steelhead trout, and the northern spotted owl."
d9a3b2bf-b264-4345-8e8e-64fcc023a7b3;geologyAndHistory;"The King Range Wilderness Area owes its unique geography to the dynamic forces of plate tectonics and erosion. Specifically, tectonic forces have caused earthquakes and have otherwise uplifted the land, while weather and the ocean have eroded the surface, forming its features. In this way, the King Range Wilderness Area is a rugged coastal mountain range that runs parallel with the San Andreas fault, which is responsible for this uplifting. In geologic terms, these mountains are relatively new, with many of the features having been formed just 20 million years ago.;This geology has played a role in the areas history and development, or the lack thereof. For example, California State Route 1 is a famous highway that runs north-south along the Pacific coast but due to the rugged terrain of what is now King Range Wilderness Area, engineers in the 1930s were forced to build and pave the highway away from the coast, leaving the “Lost Coast” as it is now known, the longest undeveloped stretch of coast in California.In 1970, Congress designated 60,000 acres of the coastal range mountains as the King Range National Conservation Area. The;federally protected lands in this area were further extended when President Clinton designated the rocks and islands offshore from the King Range National Conservation Area as the “California Coast National Monument” in 2000. Then, Congress designated 42,585 acres of the National Conservation Area as the King Range Wilderness in 2006. Today the King Range Wilderness includes some 42,694 acres."

Multiple ancient rock art and dwelling sites, including the Toquima Cave, allow present-day visitors the chance to witness the tribes’ stories and events of the distant past.The 19th century westward expansion, along with the California Gold Rush, brought a large influx of European settlers to these lands, erecting mining camps, and cutting wood for building supplies and fuel. Those mining towns and camps are still found throughout the forest, as well as the accompanying historic roads and trails.;By the end of the 19th century, the first steps towards the protection of the local natural resources were made and the lands were set aside as forest reserves.;At the time of the Great Depression, during the 1930’s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built numerous trails, campgrounds, roads, and ranger stations in the Humboldt-Toiyabe and in plenty of other forests and parks around the country. They left many historic sites that are now part of the National Register of Historic Places, e.g., the Paradise Valley and the Gold Creek Ranger Stations, to name a couple.;After a few reorganizations, the Humboldt and Toiyabe National Forests were finally joined in 1995 and are now managed as a single unit.GeologyThe state of Nevada is striped with multiple mountain ranges with expansive valleys separating them from each other. Faults are a dominant feature of the local topography that have been producing a great impact on the landscape of the area - causing the mountains to rise and the basins to lower for millions of years. Many of them still remain active and explain the significant seismic activity of the region.;Moving to the southeastern part of the Forest, let’s have a closer look at the geology of the Sierra Nevada. The beginning of the Sierra Nevada geological history is associated with the Triassic period and the formation of the area’s earliest granite. During the so-called ‘Nevadan Orogeny’ metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process, when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake that took place in 1872. "

The forest covers over 2.4 million acres and encompasses five protected wilderness areas - Absaroka-Beartooth, Fitzpatrick, North Absaroka, Popo Agie, and Washakie.Shoshone’s rugged terrain is formed by the Absaroka, Wind River, and Beartooth Mountain Ranges that vary from 4,600 to 13,804 feet. Gannett Peak, which is located in the forest, is the highest summit of Wyoming. Brooks Lake Falls is another major attraction of SNF, nestled along its namesake, Brooks Lake Creek, northwest of Dubois. Two different rock formations shape this waterfall, one having eroded much faster than the other, creating the fall’s cliff. Other highlights of the area include numerous crystal clear lakes, glacier-carved valleys, high-rolling passes, and alpine meadows - all are waiting to be explored.Recreation opportunities of this remote and untamed area will attract anyone with an interest in the outdoors - over 1,300 miles of trails, 32 campgrounds, and four Scenic Byways lay across the Shoshone. Beartooth and Chief Joseph Scenic Byways provide access from the north. The Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway follows the North Fork of the Shoshone River through the beautiful Wapiti Valley.

It might be hard to believe but the extensive eroded badlands that cover the territory today were once underwater. When the Gulf of California used to fill the Salton Trough it created a perfect environment for marine organisms. As the Grand Canyon was forming, its eroded sediment spread all the way to the Salton Trough, which gradually evolved into a land area with a system of lakes occasionally fed by the Colorado River. These processes, along with the subsequent sediment transmission from the growing Santa Rosa Mountains and other Peninsular Ranges, can be traced through the immense number of fossilized remains of ancient life found all over the Anza-Borrego region.

The lodge was located close to the modern-day trailhead of the Mount Manuel Trail. Manual and Florence Innocenti, of the Chumash Tribe, owned Davis’s property starting from 1868.In 1869, the cabin came into the possession of the French emigrants, Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet. Their son, John Pfeiffer, also became a legal landowner in the process of homesteading. To protect the beloved land from real estate development, Pfeiffer decided to sell 700 acres of his homestead to California state instead of closing a $210,000 deal with a businessman. This passionate deed explains the origin of the park’s title. The Santa Lucia Mountains are characterized by abrupt elevation and rugged slopes furrowed by ravines, as around 50 streams cross the range on their way to the sea. The elevation of the coastal escarpment varies from 4,000 to 5,155 ft. at Cone Peak.Geologic formations have put the Californian central coast under immense pressure. The state lies upon North American and Pacific crustal plates with Big Sur right on the edge of the latter one. These plates are shifting gradually over time and every displacement results in earthquakes of various magnitudes. In addition, oceanic tides are continuously gnawing at the coast. As if that were not enough, intermittent wildfires destroy greenery. Erosion caused by the above-mentioned factors amplifies the destructive power of landslides triggered by earthquakes.

Then boiling waters from underneath the landmasses went up and melted the rock in their vicinity. When the rocks cooled off, granite, monzonite, and diorite were formed.;Elevations span from 6,100 feet to 12,123 feet, with Olancha Peak being the highest point in the wilderness.;In terms of human history, the first people who inhabited the area can be traced back to 6,000 years ago, and even not later than in the late 1800s, the land was occupied by the Owens Valley Paiute and the Panamint Shoshone where they harvested fruits and hunted game. However, conflicts arose between these tribes and European settlers, and the military removed the Paiute to Fort Tejon in 1863.;The South Sierra Wilderness was awarded its current status in 1984 by the United States Congress. It is managed by the US Forest Service within Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Forest."

Shoshone and Paiute Tribes, speaking the Numic language, appeared a thousand years ago and settled the region of the Southern Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert, and Great Basin. Owens Peak Wilderness was populated by the southern Paiute (the Tubatulabals or “pine-nut eaters”) until the early twentieth century when miners and homesteaders took over these lands.;Nowadays, petroglyphs and a few rock outcroppings within the wilderness give a glimpse of former settlers’ imprints and dwellings.;Though Padre Pedro Font is believed to be the first to place the Sierra Nevada on a map, many archivists consider J.

Together with his companion,; John Fremont, and his cartographer, G. Kern, Walker explored and mapped the Owens and Indian Valleys.; Fremont also named a peak, lake, and valley after a companion that was on his third expedition to California, Richard Owens, who he used to refer to as “cool, brave and of good judgment.”;Geologically, the Owens Peak Wilderness lies within the Sierra Nevada,; a relatively young mountain range. Since a violent volcanic episode; 20 million years ago, the Sierra rose to a great height to make this legendary single range. Ongoing uplift of the range occurs due to the major fault lines on the eastern side, the Sierran Frontal Faults.;The range is shaped by the granite of the Sierra Nevada batholith. The Paleozoic Era gave rise to metamorphic rocks, while granite formed in the Cretaceous Period.; Owens Peak, in particular, is mostly made up of leucocratic, coarse-grained, equigranular, and biotite granite. The same granite type covers the ridge east of Owens Peak, leading to Five Fingers. At least two uplifts have occurred here to create the rock formations in the crest.; As a consequence of echelon faults intersecting the west-northwest edge, the Sierra’s major canyons developed at right angles to the range.;;"

During the ‘Nevadan Orogeny’ metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose, pushing up the mountains. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake that took place in 1872."

As the territory of the Forest covers a portion of the central Sierra Nevada, the geology of the Eldorado NF is closely related to the Sierra Nevada geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not ‘survived’ to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today and carved the roche moutonnées, massive basins, and erratics that define the local terrain.HistoryNumerous Indigenous Peoples made their homes in the region that later became Eldorado National Forest, the Washoe, Yokut, Wintun, and Me-Wuk were prominent here. They developed intimate knowledge of how to survive in the area - the Washoe, for example, had a system of successive fishing, gathering, and hunting periods, which helped them to use all opportunities for obtaining food in this environment of scarce resources.;;The California Gold Rush in the middle of the 19th century attracted newcomers to these lands, and they started actively using them for mining. The present-day Mokelumne Wilderness area presented great interest for prospectors being highly rich with gold sources. In 1848, a group of Oregonians founded a mining town called Mokelumne Hill, and for two decades, this place was frequented by miners from all over the world.In 1910 sections of the Stanislaus and Tahoe National Forests were merged, forming the Eldorado National Forest, with a goal of protecting the natural resources of the area from illegal sheep grazing."

fb227774-3b20-449d-85c2-70bd7d644397;geologyAndHistory;"The land that now makes up Salmon-Challis National Forest was first settled by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and the Nez Perce Tribe more than 12,000 years ago. Significant Indigenous sites and artifacts like talus pits, pictographs, and bighorn sheep hunting traps can be found throughout Salmon-Challis National Forest. Indigenous footpaths and hunting trails also help recreate the history of the area.Euro-American use of the area was first documented in 1805 during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Soon after, fur trappers began to brave the rugged mountains until the beaver population was almost decimated in the mid-1830’s. Gold and silver were discovered in Idaho in the 1860’s, leading to another boom in traders, prospectors, miners, homesteaders, and explorers visiting the land that now comprises Salmon-Challis National Forest. In 1896, Harry Guleke made the first documented continuous trip down the Main Salmon River, showing that it was possible to successfully traverse the ""River of No Return.”The mountains of Salmon-Challis National Forest are predominately a part of the Idaho-Bitterroot Rocky Mountains. This range consists largely of granite intrusions that uplifted 55 to 80 million years ago to then be carved by glaciers to form the mountains we see today. There are gold deposits throughout the Bitterroot Mountains, and this area sees a fair amount of tectonic activity."

This forest sprawls across an astounding 4.3 million acres and is one of the national forests in the lower 48 states.There are two wildernesses within the boundaries of this forest. The first wilderness area is the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, the largest wilderness area in the contiguous United States. The second one is Jim McClure-Jerry Peak Wilderness, a newer wilderness area that was established by Congress on August 7, 2015. Its namesake, Jerry Peak rises to 10,010 ft. and dominates the skyline of the southern portion of the Salmon-Challis National Forest.Idaho’s highest mountain, Borah Peak (12,662 ft.) is located within Salmon-Challis National Forest. Moreover, there are many untitled peaks around 11,000 ft. in elevation for peak baggers to explore. Another highlight of this national forest is the Salmon River Canyon, which is deeper than the Grand Canyon and ranked as the second-deepest canyon in the contiguous United States. The Salmon River Scenic Byway, Sacajawea Scenic Byway, and Peaks to Craters Scenic Byway are just a few of the highways that highlight the beauty of Salmon-Challis National Forest.Salmon-Challis National Forest offers an enormous number of trailheads for hikers, backpackers, and horseriders. Trails near Fall Creek and Williams Lake are easy and suitable for anyone, especially for novice hikers. For experienced hikers seeking solitude and a challenge, trails into Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness are more rugged and remote.In the Salmon-Challis National Forest, there are four notable rivers: Main Salmon River, Middle Fork of the Salmon River, Selway River, and Hells Canyon-Snake River. Furthermore, hundreds of picturesque lakes, streams, and rivers are nestled within beautiful alpine basins.There are 87 campgrounds and 3 rental cabins within this national forest, which means there are amazing camping opportunities for all kinds of overnight adventures.You will be surrounded by huge mountains, winding rivers, and azure lakes, all of which wait in the heart of this national forest.

Historical remains of prospecting still remain in the region, with a few old mines and derelict cabins in the southwest portion of the wilderness.The highest group of summits in the wilderness, Fifes Peaks, are remains of an extinguished caldera, whose eruptions occurred 25 million years ago. Thomas X. Fife, a placer miner, is the man Fifes Peaks were named after. Thomas, with his brothers and father John, led mining activity in the area near Chinook Pass. Camp Fife, today a Scout Camp at Goose Prairie, where Thomas lived, was named in his honor as well, as he wanted the area to belong to the Scouts.;The wilderness was designated in 1984 by the Washington State Wilderness Bill and is currently managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee and Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forests.;A horrific wildfire in 2017 affected over 50,000 acres of the wilderness, which led to several forest roads and popular campsites closing for restoration.;As for geology, the Norse Peak Wilderness is part of the North Cascades, one of the most complex and least-understood mountain ranges in the US. A theory exists that a hundred million years ago, a collision of a separate micro-continent in the Pacific Ocean formed a mountain range off the western shore of North America. These mountains were moved by oceanic plates that eventually collided with the continent, faulted, and were thrust further upward. Gradually, erosion and new faults almost leveled the mountains. Around 40 million years ago, heavy oceanic rock pushed beneath the area and, coupled with volcanic eruptions, pushed the mountains higher once again. Faulting continued over the ensuing millennia and pushed the peaks even taller, and exposed the granitic and metamorphic roots of the ancient mountains.; About five or six million years ago, the volcanic activity in the area started moving southeast, and the North Cascades have remained relatively the same as the shape we can currently see."

fecb9adf-7aae-473f-8ea2-295b15efb75d;geologyAndHistory;"The secret behind the formation of the park’s main landmark - the Castle Crags - lies in the movement of the tectonic plates. Hundreds of million years ago, when an oceanic plate collided with North America, it resulted in younger oceanic plates subsequently gliding under the western shore of the continent and bringing water with them to the deeper layers of the Earth. It caused the melting of rocks in the mantle layer, the magma then began to ascend towards the crust, and when some of this molten rock reached the surface, it created volcanoes, such as Mount Shasta. But some of the molten rock never broke out, rather it intruded and accumulated within the crust layer and solidified. That is how the Castle Crags granite was formed. Later, several factors, like the impact of glaciers and weather conditions, as well as the uplift of the Klamath Mountains, eroded the area’s sedimentary and soft rock. This left just the hard granite of the Castle Crags, sculpted in their current shape.;HistoryOriginally the park's territory and what is now known as Castle Crags Wilderness was populated by the Indigenous peoples of the Wintu, Achumawi, and Modoc Tribes. They believed that local streams, natural springs, the Sacramento River, and many other natural objects in the Castle Crags Wilderness were holy.;In the middle of the 19th century, gold prospectors from all over the world streamed into California. A keen interest in this region had been triggered by the tales about the ‘Lost Cabin Mine’ and its treasures, allegedly located there. Unfortunately, conflicts over the land and resources between the Indigenous people and the new settlers were so severe that they led to the Battle of Castle Crags in 1855 and eventually to the complete elimination or relocation of Indigenous people from the area.Over the following years, logging and mining in the region were actively developing, and in 1933 a large part of the land was acquired by citizens in an attempt to protect the local natural resources.;The official establishment of Castle Crags State Park began when the State of California purchased 925 acres of the Castle Rock Springs property in 1943."
