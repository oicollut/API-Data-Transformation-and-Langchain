The elevation starts at 6,320-feet in a sagebrush-dominated valley floor and goes up to 13,770 ft at the Grand Teton summit. Crystal alpine lakes that mirror high peaks, bright meadows, full of wildflowers, and garrulous streams that fall down rocky canyons make this park an ideal place for a visit.;The park got its name after Grand Teton, the tallest mountain of the Teton Range. It comes from ‘les trois tétons’ - ‘the three teats’ - given by early 19th-century French-speaking trappers, that was later shortened to Tetons. The range is not the only point of interest - mesmerizing 15-mile-long Jackson Lake also lies in one of the park’s valleys.Grand Teton National Park offers dozens of recreational opportunities, including mountaineering, backpacking, fishing, and many more. Hiking is extremely popular in the park, with more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over 200 miles of hiking trails."}]},

This obscure and underappreciated wilderness provides a well-developed trail system over an almost untouched landscape. Alongside the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the south and the Marble Mountain Wilderness to the north, the Russian Wilderness is part of an extensive, seemingly roadless complex, which serves as a major natural habitat in the state. Due to its remote location, the area is a heaven for those looking to immerse themselves in a secluded adventure through gorgeous alpine lakes, U-shaped glacial valleys, and botanical wonders. The Russian Wilderness is relatively small in size, so visitors can reach many of the major highlights in just about two hours of hiking or horseback riding, which gives plenty of time to soak them all in. The high density of lakes is yet another of the Russian Wilderness's notable features. Over 40 lakes and ponds are strewn through the area, the largest being Big Duck Lake, Big Blue Lake, and Paynes Lake - the swimming here is excellent, and the lakes, coupled with plentiful trout, make for great fishing spots."}]},

If this is actually the correct translation, it would make sense as the forest is noted for countless bodies of water, including some of Oregon's most beautiful waterfalls. 272-foot Watson Falls, the third-highest in the state, and the less gigantic, yet equally stunning, Susan Creek Falls and Lemolo Falls are just a few of the others that boast epic displays. Turquoise lakes and alluring ponds abound in the forest as well.Other features of the area include a massive old-growth forest, that occupies over half a million acres, and exceptional geological, and often self-descriptive, formations such as Eagle and Rattlesnake Rocks.A visit to the forest is an excellent opportunity to dive into nature as it receives fewer visitors compared to the areas nearby.;There is a vast variety of recreation activities available, with something to engage in year-round. Forest guests can enjoy hundreds of miles of trails or take a drive on the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway; horseback riding, rafting, rock climbing, fishing, and camping are among the other activities that tempt people into visiting."}]},
