Here one can truly feel far from civilization and enjoy being in sync with nature as the foot traffic here is light due to the remoteness of the area. Seven mountain summits define the alpine landscape of this area. Eagle (9,892 ft) and Warren (9,710 ft) Peaks are the most prominent ones - offering a bird\u2019s eye view over the valleys and basins of Modoc and Lassen Counties, as well as over the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. More than 80 miles of trails run through the extremely diverse terrain enabling hikers and visitors the chance to explore local flora and fauna, go fishing and hunting, and engage in water sports.Wilderness lying west of the Warner Mountains has a mild undulating outline with lovely alpine meadows and thick conifer woods, while the eastern mountain sides are steeper, rough-edged, and lack greenery.The wilderness\u2019 water resources are accumulated in various lakes and creeks flowing into the Pit River west of the Warner Mountains and to the Surprise Valley lakes east of the ridge. Patterson Lake, the biggest lake in South Warner Wilderness, is a beautiful, natural landmark secluded amidst steep rocks at 9,000 ft. A self-supporting trout population is another feature specific to this lake. Amazing Mill Creek Falls, located in the western corner of South Warner Wilderness at 5,680 ft., is open to hikers throughout the year but is most spectacular in spring when boosted by snowmelt. Ponderosa and Jeffrey pine are prevalent in the western part of the South Warner Wilderness, on the lower Warner Mountainsides, and in the northern region of Devil\u2019s Garden. White fir is also common in these forests as well as higher in the mountains where they can be found neighboring sugar and lodgepole pines. The Western juniper is another prominent representative of the wilderness's tree life, and forms one of the biggest habitats worldwide on around 300,000 acres of the nearby Devil\u2019s Garden Plateau. Mountain mahogany, quaking aspen, and purple sage are also widespread. In the marshy areas, one can also spot western black currant which is considered a rare shrub and was only registered in less than five Californian habitats. Flowers of various kinds adorn the Wilderness\u2019 and Modoc NF\u2019s land. Sweet-smelling star anemones are early bloomers but fade quickly. They are followed by an ensemble of wild pansies along with pink and red clover that create a multi-colored grandeur joined by yellow primroses and pink shooting stars. Purple lupine keeps blooming across the land till late spring. Such wildflowers as tufted saxifrage, High Sierra phlox, and Cusick\u2019s monkeyflower are among rare flowers under the protection of the South Warner Wilderness.More than 300 species of flora and fauna can be found in the area. Multiple water birds following the Pacific Flyway rest at the Modoc NF on their way to Mexico. Such graceful mammals as wild horses, rocky mountain elk, mule deer, and pronghorn antelope also inhabit the area. In 1931, the Warner Mountains received the status of a primitive area. In 1964, almost all of the current area was designated as the South Warner Wilderness under the Wilderness Act that enacted preservation of unique American lands. Most recently, back in 1984, almost 2,000 more acres were added to the wilderness area when the California Wilderness Act was passed.Elevations in the wilderness range from 4,760 feet at Surprise Valley to 9,892 feet at Eagle Peak. The Warner Mountains have a fault block structure. It is assumed that the Modoc Plateau was formed by lava flows somewhere between 15-30 million years ago. The vertical moving of fault blocks happened around 10 million years ago when the Earth\u2019s crust cracked. Thus, the upthrown blocks turned into the cliffy eastern mountainsides and downthrown blocks into the area\u2019s undulating hills and valleys. The present-day look of the wilderness has been further shaped by natural erosion and glaciers."}]}

The Bob\u2019s vast river valleys, large lush meadows, and dense coniferous forests are home to some large mammals, such as black bear, wolverine, deer, elk, moose, mountain sheep, and mountain goat. Some smaller mammals, such as beaver, river otters, snowshoe hares, and marten consider this wilderness their home, too. These lands provide habitat for threatened gray wolves and grizzly bears. In fact, the region boasts one of the highest population densities of grizzly bears in the lower-48. There is a vast variety of bird species here, including: bald eagle, falcon, osprey, hawk, owl, trumpeter swan, and pelican, to name a few. Camping areas usually attract Steller's jays, camp robbers, Clark's nutcrackers, nuthatches, chickadees, and more.Douglas fir, spruce, and larch trees dominate the old-growth forests. These lands were originally occupied by the Bitterroot Salish, Pend d\u2019Oreille, and Kootenai tribes to the west and the Blackfeet tribe to the north and east. European settlers started moving into the area in the 1700\u2019s, unfortunately bringing smallpox with them. The disease, decreasing access to resources, and increased violence put immense pressure on the tribes. Eventually, they signed treaties and were moved onto reservations - the Blackfeet Nation to the north, and the Flathead Reservation to the West. The wilderness was established in 1964 and was named after an early forester in the federal government, a conservationist and Wilderness Society cofounder, Bob Marshall. In the 1930s, Bob worked for the US Forest Service - he was responsible for keeping large areas roadless. The dry and open Rocky Mountain Front Range to the east and the densely forested and lush Swan Range and the Flathead Range to the west offer mesmerizing views from almost all open spaces within the complex."}]}

The area lies within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie and Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests, between Snoqualmie Pass to the south and Stevens Pass to the north. As home to over 700 vast alpine lakes and mountain ponds, the wilderness is known for some of the most rugged terrains in the Cascade Range, with numerous sawtooth peaks and ridges, as well as magnificent glacial valleys. Over 600 miles of trails, including 67 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, are open for hiking and backpacking. Rock-climbing, horseback riding, rafting, and many more activities are also options here. Due to its accessibility, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is a trendy destination for visitors, which can sometimes lead to the area's misuse and threaten its pristine environment. One of the most visited and picturesque areas is the Enchantments Lakes area. It is often said to have some of the best rock climbing in America with its Cashmere Crags - even though its peaks have quite intimidating names, such as Bloody Tower and Cruel Thumb. The varied Alpine Lake's landscape is covered by Douglas fir, cedar, and Western hemlock forests and spotted with alpine meadows and subalpine stands of silver fir and mountain hemlock. Avalanche chutes are home to alder and Rocky Mountain maples, while alpine larch, whitebark pine, and Engelmann spruce are frequent in the leeward alpine zone where much less rainfall occurs. The Alpine Lakes Wilderness was first designated the Alpine Lakes Limited Area in 1946. Still, it remained widely used for mining, timber extraction, and fur trapping, which resulted in clear cuts and further ecological degradation. Only in 1976, after exhausting debates and tons of effort by environmental groups, the wilderness was created by President Gerald Ford. The wilderness was later expanded by President Barack Obama and Congress in 2014, when 22,000 acres were added. When it comes to geological history, the Cascade Range originated during the Tertiary Period, when volatile tectonic activity brought about a vast uplift along a north-south axis of the present Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Produced by volcanic rock erosion and the uplift, most of the peaks occur within the Snoqualmie Batholith. This activity resulted in various rock types and formations showing themselves, including the unearthing of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks linked with micro-continents, which collided with North America about 100 million years ago. Another superb formation is the 80- to 90-million-year-old batholith underlying the Stuart Range. During the Pleistocene epoch, glaciation gave rise to signature U-shaped valleys scattered throughout the wilderness.Nowadays, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is known for having one of the most rugged terrains in the Cascade Range, with numerous sawtooth peaks and ridges, alongside magnificent glacial valleys spotted with over 700 emerald lakes and mountain ponds.  The diverse terrain within Alpine Lakes provides habitat for black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, mountain beavers, black bears on the west side of the Cascade Crest, while the east part is home to Rocky Mountain elk, mountain goats, cougars, bobcats, gray wolves, and an occasional grizzly bear. Plenty of at-risk species populate the area, such as wolverine, lynx, fisher, spotted owl, peregrine falcon, and many others. Over 150 bird species, including bald and golden eagles, pileated woodpeckers, and varied thrushes, have been reported by birdwatchers."}]}

The forest is broken into several separate sections and encompasses parts of 17 counties. Thousands of acres of forest land is designated wilderness that includes a portion of Bob Marshall Complex and Gates of the Mountains Wilderness. About 200 square miles of the forest belong to the Badger-Two Medicine Area - sacred lands of the Blackfeet Nation that are south and west of Glacier National Park. The forest is famous for its gorgeous mountain terrain, with elevations ranging from 4,500 to 9,362 feet. It straddles the Continental Divide and encompasses multiple ranges, including Big Belt Mountains, Rocky Mountain Range, Snowy Mountains, Castle Mountains, and some others. Broad prairies, marshlands, river valleys, and rolling hills contribute to Helena-Lewis and Clark NFs environmental diversity. Over 2,200 miles of hiking trails take visitors to pristine alpine lakes, waterfalls, streams, mountain summits, deep gorges, and numerous other amazing natural and cultural features, including the Chinese Wall - one of the most remarkable geological wonders in Montana! Conifer trees, including Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce mainly dominate the forest. Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest is inhabited by many exciting species of fauna. It is home to black bear, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, mountain lion, elk, wolverine, gray wolf, white-tailed deer, beaver, porcupine, woodchuck, cougar, moose, bobcat, coyote, fox, and some endangered species, such as grizzly bear and Canadian lynx. Birdwatching is enjoyable here as well - look for bald eagles, peregrine falcons, sandhill cranes, grouse, wood ducks, red-tailed hawks, and trumpeter swans. Streams and lakes in the forest are teeming with freshwater trout. For millennia, the lands of what is now Helena-Lewis and Clark NF were used by the Blackfeet, Flathead, Sioux, Crow, Kutenai, and Cheyenne people.By the 19th century, Europeans and Americans began to explore and develop this area. The land, rich with gold and other minerals, brought people from the whole world, and it gave a start to mining activity in this area. The Lewis and Clark Forest Reserve was established in 1897, and in 1906 it was designated as a National Forest by the U.S. Forest Service. The forest was named after two American explorers, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who led an expedition (c. 1803-1806) to explore the new western territories acquired after the Louisiana Purchase. The Helena National Forest appeared in 1906 as Helena Forest Reserve. In 2015, Lewis and Clark National Forest and Helena National Forest were combined. Helena-Lewis and Clark NF is located along the west side of the Continental Divide and belongs to the Atlantic watershed. Most of the mountains in the forest are made of sedimentary rock that formed between the Precambrian and Jurassic periods. Glaciation, erosion, seismic uplift, wind, and time have been the prime architects of this spectacular terrain. The forest encompasses several impressive mountain ranges: Rocky Mountain Range, Big Belt Mountains, Snowy Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Castle Mountains, Highwood Mountains, and Elkhorn Mountains."}]}

Here you will find Indigenous Peoples\u2019 sites in what is the Western Abenaki's tribal homeland, alongside the remains of colonial farmsteads, and evidence of industrial era technologies - roads, structures, and facilities built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's.Unwise land use and unregulated logging caused damage to the forest\u2019s ecosystems and watersheds. The Green Mountain National Forest and the Finger Lakes National Forest were established in 1932 and 1985 respectively, and later united into one administrative unit. Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests are temperate broadleaf and mixed woods, which mostly consist of northern deciduous trees and some occasional patches of conifers, meadows, and wetlands. Such plant communities are typical of the New England and Acadian ecoregions. Mammals that roam these woodlands include moose, white-tailed deer, black bears, coyotes, Indiana bats, beavers, and many others. Wild turkeys, ruffed grouse, falcons, barred owls, bald eagles, rusty blackbirds, Bicknell's thrush, barred owls, and many other bird species inhabit the forests. You can learn more about wildlife in Green Mountain National Forest on the iNaturalist website. The Green Mountain National Forest is located in southwestern and central Vermont.

The forest encompasses Agua Tibia Wilderness, Hauser Wilderness, Pine Creek Wilderness, and San Mateo Canyon Wilderness. The iconic Pacific Crest Trail winds its way through the forest lands and visits some of its most outstanding highlights. In this area, a hiker can enjoy Kitchen Creek Falls, impressive views of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, and the Laguna Mountains plateau, which gives you an excellent chance to move from the desert to forested mountain tops, all in one trip. The views are even better from the highest points, such as Santiago, Stephenson, Monument, Garnet, and Hayes Peaks, as well as Foster Point, just to name a few. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Arizona and Northern Mexico. Cleveland NF mostly consists of scrublands and a few riparian areas. Yet, it is possible to find ponds and wet meadows, which can surprise those who think Southern California is an endless desert. For this reason, Big Laguna Lake, Little Laguna Lake, and Water of the Woods are popular hiking destinations.Diverse species of large mammals include mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, coyotes, and gray foxes. Small critters such as the ringtail cat, long-tail weasel, opossum, blacktail jackrabbit, desert cottontail, and California ground squirrel widely inhabit the area as well. Along with over 200 bird-species, including the red-tailed hawk, horned grebe, turkey vulture, and house wren. Moreover, the forest supports 19 threatened and endangered plants and animals. Among them are the southwestern willow flycatcher, the coastal California gnatcatcher, Least Bell\u2019s vireo, and the Laguna Mountains skipper. Due to loss of habitat to a nearby home and business development, the Cleveland National Forest has become even more important for these species\u2019 survival.As for vegetation, chaparral predominates, in particular, chemise, manzanita, and ceanothus. Scarce riparian (streamside) areas sprawl the area as well. Meadows and sections near streams are profuse with large oaks, while higher elevations are home to Jeffrey and Coulter Pine groves. Cleveland National Forest's lands were populated by humans presumably 10,000 years ago, and before Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo of Spain's arrival in 1542, they were known only to Indigenous Tribes. The Kumeyaay, Luise\u00f1os, Cahuilla, and Cupe\u00f1o Tribes securely lived off hunting and profuse acorns. Despite Cabrillo's visit, these lands gained little attention until 1769, when the Peninsular Range and its coastal plain aroused great interest. Not to let England and Russia interfere in the territory, Spain supported Jun\u00edpero Serra in conducting his first California Missions. Since that time, explorers began to have a huge impact on the pristine lands, much beyond that of the previous centuries. In 1869, a gold Mother Lode was discovered near Julian and brought many miners to the area. At the same time, zinc, lead, and silver minings were flourishing in the Santa Anas' western canyons. Additionally, in Trabuco Canyon, one may still find remnants of a large and inefficient tin mine whose owner from the Eagle Milk Co was wanting to produce cans for his milk.Mining degraded the lands with timber cuts and brush burning for miners to enter new areas to seek out minerals. Reports from the 1870's - 1880's stated fires were burning out of control at times for weeks, causing severe damage and lacking support from a forest reserve. As a result, in 1891, the Forest Reserve Act was signed. Though it was supposed to reduce destructive and unauthorized timber cutting, it had a different meaning in California: concerns about watershed protection, significantly impacted by ongoing fires, was a more important matter then. Overall, the Cleveland National Forest has a rich (and sorrowful) fire history, including the two largest wildfires in California: the Cedar Fire of 2003 and the 1889 Santiago Canyon Fire, which resulted in vast burnt sections and many animal species being threatened.Named in honor of President Cleveland, an immense 1,904,826 acre National Forest was established by President Roosevelt in 1908, which was followed by its gradual partition. At present, the Cleveland National Forest comprises 460,000 acres.As for geology, the Santa Ana, Palomar, and Laguna (Cuyamaca) Mountains rise through the forest. These three mountain ranges make up a part of the Peninsular Range, which stretches 800 miles from the Santa Ana Mountains to Baja California."}]}

In 1911, the United States Forest Service purchased 31,000 acres of land in northern Georgia for $7 per acre. This territory was bought at Roscoe Nicholson\u2019s suggestion, who was the first forest ranger in Georgia, and later, this initial territory would become the Chattahoochee National Forest but for now it was considered part of the Nantahala and Cherokee NF\u2019s. Nicholson continued developing the area, and another ranger, Arthur Woody, also contributed to the development process - he brought trout and deer back to the area after these animals disappeared due to unwise land and resource use. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated the Chattahoochee its own National Forest. The forest took its name from the Chattahoochee River - where chatta means \u2018stone\u2019, and ho chee stands for \u2018marked\u2019 or \u2018flowered\u2019 in one dialect of the Muskogean languages.

Ventana Wilderness lies within the Santa Lucia Mountains, a fairly young range created within the past 5 million years. The range contains over 200 named peaks, with Junipero Serra Peak (5,869 ft.) as the highest. Underlain by the predominantly granitic bedrock from the Salinian Block, the Santa Lucia Mountains were formed through the shifting of tectonic plates along the numerous transverse faults in the area.HistoryAccording to a popular legend, the park owes its name to Ventana Double Cone\u2019s unique notch that used to be a natural stone arch. Spanish settlers called it \u201cventana\u201d which means \u201cwindow\u201d in Spanish. For thousands of years, the Big Sur Coast was inhabited by ancestors of modern Salinan, Esselen, and Ohlone people who made seasonal rounds through the area as they lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Majestic Pico Blanco, surrounded by the north and south forks of the Little Sur River, was considered sacred for some Ohlone tribes and the Esselen. After Spaniards, Mexicans, and Americans had started colonizing Big Sur, the population of indigenous people was almost devastated.Ventana Wilderness was established in 1978 as part of the Endangered American Wilderness Act, and in 1992 Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act added about 38,800 acres to the existing wilderness.

Although the flow normally peaks in early spring, visitors can enjoy this 120-foot twin waterfall all year round. Silver Peak \u2014 the area\u2019s namesake \u2014 along with Mount Mars are the most prominent peaks in the wilderness. Reaching an elevation of 3,590 feet, Silver Peak is the highest.The best time to take advantage of the solitude and serenity this backcountry gem provides is late fall through early spring. Hikers can expect some steep terrain with trail difficulty ranging from moderate to strenuous. Beware of some poison oak overgrowth. Beginners can enjoy a short hike out to the gorgeous Salmon Creek Falls for a glimpse of what the wilderness has to offer, while seasoned backpackers will appreciate the adventure of the less developed trails. Campsites abound and are generally well-maintained though primitive. As a special treat, venture out to Lion\u2019s Den Camp and secure the hilltop site to enjoy a night under the stars and have expansive ocean views greeting you in the morning. GeologyThe Silver Peak Wilderness lies within the Santa Lucia Mountains, which is a fairly young range created within the past 5 million years. The range contains over 200 named peaks, with Junipero Serra Peak (5,869 ft.) as the highest. Underlain by the predominantly granitic bedrock from the Salinian Block, the Santa Lucia Mountains were formed through the shifting of tectonic plates along the numerous transverse faults in the area.HistoryThe Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act of 1992 established the Silver Peak Wilderness as a protected area of approximately 14,500 acres. On December 19, 2002, 17,055 more acres containing the watersheds of Willow Creek and San Carpoforo Creek were designated as part of the wilderness as per the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act. This brought the total acreage of the wilderness up to 31,555.The first known inhabitants of Big Sur are the Ohlone, Esselen, and Salinan Tribes \u2014 nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved from coastal areas to inland forests depending on the availability of food sources. However, their populations were decimated by the advent of Spanish colonization in the late 1700s.The Spanish founded Monterey as their colony\u2019s capital north of the land they called \u201cEl Sur Grande\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Big South\u201d due to its sheer size and lack of exploration. Big Sur became a part of Mexico in 1821, following the country\u2019s declaration of independence from Spain. Mexico\u2019s defeat in the Mexican-American War forced it to cede California to the United States in 1848.After the US passed the Homestead Act of 1862, the first homesteaders started to arrive and settle in Big Sur. They lend their names to many local features, such as Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and Bixby Creek. The late 19th century was marked by the development of lumber and tanoak bark industries along with the Big Sur Gold Rush that created the area\u2019s own boomtown at the head of Alder Creek. But the rugged and often impassable terrain did not allow for adequate infrastructure and industrial development, so the territory remained largely isolated until the construction of Highway 1. Its completion in 1937 ushered in a new era of recreation-focused commercial development. While the highway construction did adversely affect the area\u2019s ecosystems, some of the first land preservation efforts were also initiated at that time. The wilderness boasts a diverse mix of vegetation, which includes such treasures as the world\u2019s southernmost grove of redwoods and the rare endemic Santa Lucia fir. Also found here are Sargent cypress, gray pines, Coulter pines, Coast live oak, and numerous other oak species. The area\u2019s wide variety of ecosystems allows hikers to discover massive conifers that give way to the chaparral-covered slopes and the lush grassy meadows adorned with towering oaks. Spring adds a vibrant display of blooming California poppies, Chaparral yucca, and other wildflowers to the picture.Among the animals calling the area home are deer, bobcats, mountain lions, foxes, raccoons, and wild boars. Birdwatchers will be delighted by the incredible diversity of the local bird population, which includes the iconic California condor."}]}

The Park sits in a deep glacial valley interspersed with a vast network of small lakes, rivers, and streams. Abundant with brook and golden trout, they present great attraction to anglers. Astounding biodiversity is revealed through the chain of elevational zones, each presenting a unique ecosystem.Kings Canyon National Park shares a broad Wilderness area with the adjacent Sequoia National Park they were joined in 1943 and have been managed as a single unit since then. The Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness takes up the bulk of the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks territory, providing a wide space for adventure. Miles of hiking trails, led by the prominent Pacific Crest Trail and traverses the Park along its eastern border, provide opportunities to feast your eyes on the fantastic scenery and enjoy an unparalleled hiking experience. Significant elevation change creates an impressive diversity of plant and animal species. Vegetation zones starting in the foothills with oak woodlands and chaparral are followed by pine forests which eventually turn into alpine meadows as you move higher in the mountains. Pines of the montane and subalpine zones are represented by white fir, sugar, incense-cedar, red fir, ponderosa, whitebark, foxtail, and limber pines. Outstanding members of this community, giant sequoias win in terms of size but are outnumbered by the pine trees. Wildlife is distributed in a similar way, according to the zones. Typical mammals in the foothills are gray fox, bobcat, striped and spotted skunks, black bear, woodrat, pocket gopher, and white-footed mouse; with plenty of birds and reptiles as well: California quail, scrub jay, lesser goldfinch, wrentit, acorn woodpecker, gopher snake, California kingsnake, striped racer, western whiptail lizard, and the California newt. Chickaree, gray and golden-mantled ground squirrels, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, and a variety of birds populate the montane forests and meadows. Marmot, pika, and white-tailed jackrabbit live in the subalpine and alpine areas. GeologyThe topography of the Kings Canyon National Park encompasses portions of two grand geological formations: the foothills of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada range. The terrain was shaped by Pleistocene glaciers and subduction along the North American\u2013Pacific Plate boundary that created peaks, canyons, domes, glacial lakes, and marble caves.High peaks in the east of the parks (from 12,000 to 14,000 feet) descend steeply to the elevations of 4,500 feet in the western part, thus creating an impressive contrast. Mountains and canyons are mostly composed of granite, diorite, and monzonite which are 100 million years old igneous intrusive rocks. Yet, the Sierra Nevada Range is only 10 million years old and was formed when the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block tilted and uplifted under the influence of tectonic forces in the region of the Great Basin. The impact of the glaciers is evident through the U-shaped valleys of Cedar Grove, Paradise Valley, and Tehipite Valley. Tehipite Dome, the biggest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, was also formed by glaciers. Although nothing is left of those ancient glaciers these days, it doesn\u2019t mean there are no glaciers in the parks: they are found on the highest peaks and they are surprisingly rather young (~1,000 years old). However, they are melting swiftly and it is very likely they will soon disappear because of rising temperatures. As for the area's history, the park was originally populated by the Monache. They primarily occupied the vicinity of the Kaweah River (i.e., the Foothills region) but they also used the mountain passes as trade routes. European settlers brought with them diseases new to the Indigenous Peoples and as the result, their population shrank substantially in a short period of time. Another problem the Monache had to face was the loss of their lands as the settlers began actively using the natural resources of the area, the Giant Sequoia trees being one of them. In 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established in an attempt to preserve the land and protect the trees from logging. Kings Canyon National Park was designated in 1940 largely because of (and thanks to!) John Muir\u2019s activism. The two parks united in 1943 due to their closeness and similarities."}]}

Archeological evidence indicates that Indigenous People lived in these territories at least 10,000 years ago. New Hampshire Archeological Society offers more information about their settlements. Europeans started exploring these lands in the mid-17th century. The area was first protected under the Weeks Act of 1911, which aimed to preserve headwater streams and other territories damaged by logging. These mountains suffered a lot in the late 1800\u2019s - erosion, cleared lands, and fire damage led to President Hoover designating  White Mountain National Forest in 1918. "}]}

From 8,000 - 500 BCE groups made seasonal rounds through the area as they lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Eventually, groups acquired domesticated plants through trade and settled down in the area to farm. These groups were known as the Fremont and the ancestral Puebloans. In the 19th century, pioneers and missionaries began to explore and develop these lands. Some of the Canyonlands was used as pastures until the 1970s.Bates Wilson, the Arches National Monument Superintendent, first proposed a park here in the late 1950s as a way to preserve the view from Grand View Point at Island in the Sky.

According to studies, the oldest rocks in this section of the High Cascades started to form after multiple volcanic eruptions, between three and five million years ago.The Mount Mazama and Mount McLoughlin stratovolcanoes started to grow less than one million years ago, during the \u2018Ice Age\u2019, and the latter erupted for the last time between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago. The north and east sides of Mount McLoughlin show traces of it being carved out by the ice, and Seven Lakes Basin, Rogue River's Middle Fork, as well as other large drainages found in the Wilderness, were formed by glaciers, too.Rising temperatures melted the glaciers around 12,000 years ago, but the volcanic activity did not cease, although it occurred on a smaller scale. The formation of cinder cones, stretching from Goosenest Mountain north into Crater Lake National Park, also happened during this period.The eruption and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama, approximately 6,700 years ago, created the Crater Lake caldera, and left a blanket of pumice on the northern part of the Wilderness, which is commonly referred to as the \u2018Oregon Desert\u2019.HistoryThousands of years ago, the ancestors of the Klamath and the Takelma tribes used the area that is now known as Sky Lakes Wilderness for hunting and foraging. However, they did not create permanent settlements here due to adverse weather conditions that affect the area most of the year. The first European settlers explored the area while hunting, trapping, grazing stock, and picking huckleberries.After the area came under the management of the USFS in 1906, the trails and fire lookout towers were built there. The Sky Lakes Wilderness was officially designated in 1984."}]}

If you\u2019re looking for striking volcanic features, meadows strewn with wildflowers, gorgeous mountain views, and glacially sculpted terrain, you\u2019re in the right place. Lassen is home to some of the most spectacular hydrothermal features in the Cascades: bubbling mud pots, steaming ground, and hissing fumaroles. Be sure to check Bumpass Hell, Sulphur Works, and Boiling Spring Lakes - yet another evidence of Lassen\u2019s fiery volcanic past. Notably, more than forty volcanoes occupy the park\u2019s landscape, with the largest plug dome volcano on Earth, Lassen Peak. With a plethora of geological wonders, historic sites, and breathtaking views, it is no surprise Lassen Volcanic National Park receives a half-million visitors annually. Lassen Volcanic National Park sprawls through the northern part of the Sierra Nevada ecoregion and features three ecological zones.Mixed conifer forest of Ponderosa and Jeffrey Pines, Sugar Pine, and White Fir cover elevations below 6,500 feet, along with manzanita, gooseberry, and ceanothus species. Areas up to 8,000 feet are home to Red Fir forests, interspersed with Western White Pine, Mountain Hemlock, and Lodgepole Pine. Finally, Whitebark Pine and Mountain Hemlock with rock spirea, lupin, and penstemon are amongst a few species covering subalpine areas. Wildlife abounds in the park as well. Visitors will have the chance to encounter a variety of local mammals, like a black bear, mule deer, cougar, coyote, and bobcat. Smaller critters of Lassen Volcanic Park include weasel, chipmunk, raccoon, pika, marten, and skunk, as well as a diverse range of bat species. Interestingly, the largest number of the Sierra Nevada red fox species, which is one of the rarest mammals in California, populate the Lassen Volcanic Park.As for birdwatching, many exciting bird species call the area home, including Steller's Jay, Mountain Chickadee, Anna's Hummingbird, and Rough-legged Hawk. Lassen Volcanic National Park has a rich human history. The Lassen area first served as a meeting point and seasonal settlement for at least four Indigenous Tribes: the Atsugewi, Yana, Yahi, and Maidu. They used to go hunting and gathering in the Lassen region, though only in warmer months due to high elevation, snow conditions, and seasonally mobile deer populations. The Atsugewi split into two bands, the Atsuge and the Apwaruge, and settled the area around Hat Creek and Hat Creek Valley in winter, and for spring and summer, they moved to the Hat Creek and Lost Creek drainages. Southeastern slopes, including Warner Valley and Juniper Lake, were inhabited by the Maidu Tribes. Their descendants still live in the land of their ancestors, regardless of conquest and settlement of tribal lands by European and American prospectors. Most of the year, the foothills along Mill Creek and west-flowing waters were inhabited by Yana and Yahi, who traveled to higher elevations during warmer months. The park\u2019s namesake, Lassen Peak, was named after a Danish blacksmith, Peter Lassen, who guided newcomers in the 1830\u2019s over the peak to the Sacramento Valley. Lassen Volcanic National Park was originally designated as the Lassen Peak Forest Preserve. In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone U.S. National Monuments. Due to their striking volcanic beauty and erosion concerns, both of them, with the surrounding area, became Lassen Volcanic National Park in 1916.When it comes to geology, Lassen Volcanic National Park is situated in the most southern part of the Cascade Mountain Range. As well as the other volcanoes in the range, Lassen Peak is a part of the Cascade volcanic arc, stretching from southern British Columbia to northern California. The arc formed due to the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate. The process of Pacific Ocean tectonic plates plunging below the North American Plate has lasted hundreds of millions of years. Consequently, its magma has resulted in scores of striking volcanic landscapes in California, not to mention Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Between about 600,000 and 350,000 years ago, the western part of the park was taken over by Mount Tehama, a stratovolcano that formed a caldera about 3 miles in width. Several volcanic peaks occupy the rim of the now-eroded caldera. One of them being Lassen Peak, which periodically exploded between 1914 and 1921, with the most dramatic explosion in 1915.A few other glimpses of volcanic activity include Cinder Cone, Chaos Crags, and Bumpass Hell, the park\u2019s largest geothermal area with bubbling mud pots, sulfurous vents, and steaming fumaroles. Lassen Volcanic National Park, one of just a few places in the world to do so, features all four volcano types: shield, composite, cinder cone, and plug dome. Its volcanic domes belong to the active Lassen Volcanic Center, whose eruption history started approximately 825,000 years ago."}]}

Sometimes referred to as \u201cJohn of the Mountains,\u201d Muir was undoubtedly the most influential environmental advocate in the history of Sierra and its surrounding lands. Jointly managed by the Inyo and Sierra National Forests, the area encompasses over half a million acres within the Sierra Nevada Range. 57 summits over 13,000 feet, including the highest peak in the continental United States, Mt. Whitney, lie within the wilderness, making it a heaven for climbers and mountaineers. For the trivia buffs out there, the wilderness actually boasts the largest continuous area above 10,000 feet elevation in the lower 48. The iconic John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails, extensive alpine meadows, glacially carved canyons, crystal clear mountain streams, and trickling hot springs are just a few of the other reasons the area is America\u2019s second most-visited wilderness.  The John Muir Wilderness is notable for the largest contiguous territory above 10,000 feet in the continental United States. Multiple subalpine meadows and fell-fields above 10,800 feet are scattered throughout the entire wilderness. Lodgepole, whitebark, and western pines, red fir, and mountain hemlock cover elevations from 9,000 feet to 10,800 feet, while lower hills consist of Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, and red and white fir. As for wildlife, yellow-bellied marmot, black bear, pika, golden-mantled ground squirrel, California Bighorn Sheep, and Clark's nutcracker are great examples of local wildlife wilderness guests could run into. The wilderness is also trout country that features dozens of lakes filled with brown, cutthroat, rainbow, golden, and brook trout. The wilderness is named in honor of legendary John Muir, one of America\u2019s most influential naturalists, who needs no introduction. A Scottish-American environmentalist, co-founder of the Sierra Club in 1892, father of the American wilderness preservation movement, and a skillful mountaineer, his actions were influential in preserving Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Park, and he served as an inspiration to protect numerous tracks of natural beauty across the country. John Muir was also the first to propound the idea that glaciers carved out much of Yosemite Valley; in contrast with Josiah Whitney\u2019s now-disproved theory, which considered a catastrophic earthquake to be the reason to form the magnificent geology of Yosemite Valley. Together with the contribution to environmental awareness, John Muir inspired generations of Americans to preserve their health and freedom through simply walking in nature. The eastern Sierra escarpment, where the John Muir Wilderness lies, was generated over 10 million years ago when the bedrock granite of the Sierra Nevada started rising. Simultaneously, what we now know as Antelope Valley, Long Valley, and the Owens Valley, began to settle along the Owens Valley fault line. Still to this day, the Sierra rises about 1.5 inches every century, which is really swift in terms of geological time. The uplift rate lifts the terrain faster than erosion wears it down, which leads to ever-higher elevations. Also interesting, due to the fact that the Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range and features relatively little soil, flora and fauna here are restricted to only the hardiest species."}]}

It is named to honor an environmentalist and one of the most well-known American photographers, Ansel Adams - dedicated to art just as much as to wilderness preservation. Once a part of Yosemite, the area features some of the most spectacular vistas in the Sierra with sweeping granite ridges, turquoise lakes, and alpine meadows with a few small glaciers on the northern and northeastern peaks. The wilderness lies primarily within the Sierra National Forest, sharing management with Inyo National Forest and Devil's Postpile National Monument. Besides profuse hiking and backpacking trails, visitors can immerse themselves in such recreational opportunities as horseback riding, hunting, fishing, nature viewing, and mountaineering. Vast areas above the treeline are covered by alpine meadows and fell fields dotted with glacial lakes and wildflowers. Lodgepole pine, red fir, and Jeffrey pine can be found at lower elevations. As for wildlife, black bear, mule deer, marmot, Bighorn sheep, coyote, and stoat (ermine), among others, consider this place their home. Birdwatching is excellent here, too. Keep your eyes open for Red-tailed hawk, Dark-eyed junco, Dusky grouse, Buff-bellied Pipit, and others. Initially, the area was designated the Minarets Wilderness in 1964 and renamed in honor of Ansel Adams after his death in 1984. Ansel Adams was a world-famous landscape photographer known for his powerful voice for natural beauty. His photography, especially of the Sierra Nevada Range and Yosemite National Park, along with his involvement with the Sierra Club, drew much attention to wilderness preservation.In the heart of the Ansel Adams Wilderness is the Ritter Range, a small mountain range, which holds some dark metavolcanic glaciated mountains, including Mount Ritter, Banner Peak, and The Minarets. Its bedrock started to form in the Cretaceous Era when tectonic subduction gradually resulted in the Sierra Nevada batholith formation. In terms of human history, the Me-Wuk, Monache, Mono, Washo, and Shoshone tribes have inhabited the area for thousands of years. European and American history started in the 1870s when settlers arrived in a town near Mammoth Lakes. In the next few years, many prospectors came in search of gold, though all the primary mining spots closed by the 1880s. After the temporary quiet, at the turn of the century, more visitors and settlers came to the region for tourism and homesteading."}]}

The elevation starts at 6,320-feet in a sagebrush-dominated valley floor and goes up to 13,770 ft at the Grand Teton summit. Crystal alpine lakes that mirror high peaks, bright meadows, full of wildflowers, and garrulous streams that fall down rocky canyons make this park an ideal place for a visit. The park got its name after Grand Teton, the tallest mountain of the Teton Range. It comes from \u2018les trois t\u00e9tons\u2019 - \u2018the three teats\u2019 - given by early 19th-century French-speaking trappers, that was later shortened to Tetons. The range is not the only point of interest - mesmerizing 15-mile-long Jackson Lake also lies in one of the park\u2019s valleys.Grand Teton National Park offers dozens of recreational opportunities, including mountaineering, backpacking, fishing, and many more. Hiking is extremely popular in the park, with more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over 200 miles of hiking trails. The Teton Range landscape wasn't created overnight - it took the planet billions of years. Natural forces such as earthquakes, glaciers, and erosion have shaped this magnificent territory. Some of the oldest rocks in North America are present in the park - gneiss, a 2.7 billion-year-old metamorphic rock, makes up much of the Teton Range. It was formed when two tectonic plates collided - then seafloor sediments and volcanic debris buried it up to 18 miles deep. A similar collision of plates created the Himalayas! The intense heat and pressure changed these sediments and separated different minerals - nowadays, you can see that in the rock\u2019s zebra-striped layers. After that, molten magma squeezed into cracks, cooled, and crystallized into igneous granite. This range itself is one of the youngest in North America, uplifting for less than 10 million years. In comparison, the Rockies are 50-80 million years old, and the Appalachians are older than 300 million years. Erosion hasn\u2019t influenced these mountains much, so their jagged peaks are still tall. The Teton fault is still active, and 7.0-7.5 magnitude earthquakes can occur from time to time. More recently it was the glaciers' turn - during Pleistocene Ice Age, they sculpted the landscape, widening V-shaped river canyons into U-shaped glacial canyons and forming cavities for future lakes. About 200,000 years ago, the glaciers flowed and left behind outwash plains of gravel and cobbles - now the plains are covered by sagebrush, and conifer trees cover former glaciers' borders. Before receding, glaciers carried cobbles, boulders, and gravel, that presently form moraines and mark the glaciers' terminuses. These lands saw the first people 11,000 years ago, when the first nomadic Indigenous Tribes came for hunting and gathering during warm months. They entered the Jackson Hole valley and left behind stone tools, tipi rings, and fire pits. In summer, the tribes came to harvest berries and bulbs, fish the streams and lakes, and hunt wildlife. As it got colder, they migrated to warmer areas.The first European explorers came here in the early 19th century. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted major fur-trading companies. Eventually, in the 1880\u2019s, the area was settled by homesteaders and ranchers. Though they struggled to farm and raise cattle due to the rocky and sandy soil - many of them turned to tourism and \u2018dude ranches,\u2019 and found the success that led to the area\u2019s further development.It took a long time of fighting for this territory\u2019s protection to gain the National Park status. It all began in the late 19th century and continued for decades - with the eventual involvement and lobbying of John D. Rockefeller - Grand Teton National Park was finally established in 1929. Rockefeller actually went on to donate all of the land (35,000+ acres) he purchased in the area to expand the park in 1950. Grand Teton National Park\u2019s ecosystem is almost pristine, so visitors have the chances to find flora and fauna that have existed here since prehistoric times. More than 1,000 species of plants, dozens of mammal and fish species, 300 species of birds, and a few species of reptiles and amphibians consider this park their home. There are four major zones within the park: alpine, forest, sagebrush flats, and wetlands. Mammals that roam this park include moose, elk, mule deer, grizzly and black bears, bison, pronghorn, wolves, and mountain lions. On the valley floor, uinta ground squirrels, red squirrels, and least chipmunks are pretty common, while badgers, long-tailed weasels, pine martens, and wolverines exist but are rarely encountered. Pikas, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and yellow-bellied marmots inhabit rocky areas of the park, so be on the lookout for them. River otter, muskrat, and beaver can be spotted in the park\u2019s waters. Not far from them, you can see six species of amphibians that live in Grand Teton: boreal chorus frogs, boreal toads, spotted frogs, tiger salamanders, northern leopard frogs, and bullfrogs. Watch out - there are three species of snakes (wandering garter, valley garter, and rubber boa) that typically live near water. Fortunately, there are no venomous snakes in the park. If you are lucky enough, you might see the calliope hummingbird - the smallest North American bird that weighs less than a tenth of an ounce (be on the lookout when you pass willow shrubs and blooming scarlet gilia). The largest waterfowl, the trumpeter swan, can be found in the park, too - at Swan Lake, Oxbow Bend, and Flat Creek. Osprey and bald eagles hunt and nest near water here, too. The variety of vegetation astounds, too, and includes lodgepole, whitebark, and limber pines, Engelmann and blue spruce, and Douglas and subalpine fir. Under these trees, there are many lichens, mosses, and liverworts. In spring, various wildflowers tint the park\u2019s lands - silvery lupine, scarlet gilia, low larkspur, moss campion, alpine forget-me-not, and sky pilot. Antelope bitterbrush, low sagebrush, and rabbitbrush are the common shrubs growing in the park."}]}

This obscure and underappreciated wilderness provides a well-developed trail system over an almost untouched landscape. Alongside the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the south and the Marble Mountain Wilderness to the north, the Russian Wilderness is part of an extensive, seemingly roadless complex, which serves as a major natural habitat in the state. Due to its remote location, the area is a heaven for those looking to immerse themselves in a secluded adventure through gorgeous alpine lakes, U-shaped glacial valleys, and botanical wonders. The Russian Wilderness is relatively small in size, so visitors can reach many of the major highlights in just about two hours of hiking or horseback riding, which gives plenty of time to soak them all in. The high density of lakes is yet another of the Russian Wilderness's notable features. Over 40 lakes and ponds are strewn through the area, the largest being Big Duck Lake, Big Blue Lake, and Paynes Lake - the swimming here is excellent, and the lakes, coupled with plentiful trout, make for great fishing spots.  The Russian Wilderness with the surrounding Klamath Mountains is considered an important refuge for flora and fauna in California and is noted for its biodiversity. Seventeen conifer species co-exist here in one square mile, which is likely more than anywhere else on the planet. Large stands of rare-for-California subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce cover the wilderness landscape, along with foxtail pine, whitebark pine, Jeffrey pine, Shasta fir, and Pacific yew, to name a few. As for wildlife, the wilderness supports a great diversity of mammals, including black-tailed deer, fishers, martens, beavers, coyotes, and even wolverines. Black bears and mountain lions also roam the area. The wilderness is a great option for birdwatching, too, with California quail, northern pileated woodpecker, Townsend\u2019s Solitaire, and Hermit Warbler nesting here. Local lakes and streams hold stocks of brown trout, eastern brook trout, and rainbow trout. What is now called the Russian Wilderness was populated by multiple Indigenous Tribes, including the Karuk, the Tolowa Dee-ni\u2019, the Yurok, the Shasta, the Konomihu, and the Hoopa, for thousands of years. In contrast with the major part of coastal California, this region was rougher and less visited by the early European immigrants. During the mid-1800\u2019s, fur trappers and hunters went on expeditions through the area after the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company set up a central trading station in Portland, Oregon, in the middle of the 1820\u2019s. After a gold discovery in the Russian Wilderness, near the city of Yreka in the 1850\u2019s, present-day Siskiyou County received a large influx of prospectors and miners. The federal government initially put the region under their management in 1905, but only in 1984 did the Russian Wilderness gain official protection as a natural, roadless area. When it comes to geology, the Russian Wilderness peaks belong to the Klamath Mountains, a remote range in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon. In particular, they are part of one of the Klamath subranges, the Salmon Mountains. Along with other subranges - the Marble Mountains, Eddy Range, Castle, and the largest one, the Siskiyou Mountains, they are part of a continuing system of mountain ranges that stretch through the western edge of North America and includes the California Ranges, the Canadian Coast Mountains, and others. Together with adjacent Trinity Alps and Marble Wildernesses, the Russian Wilderness also forms an important continuous corridor for California wildlife, e.g. migrating herds of black-tailed deer. The Russian Wilderness is primarily underlain by glacier-carved granite crags formed during the Mesozoic Era, and as a result, the geology is similar to that of the Sierra Nevada."}]}

Turquoise lakes and alluring ponds abound in the forest as well.Other features of the area include a massive old-growth forest, that occupies over half a million acres, and exceptional geological, and often self-descriptive, formations such as Eagle and Rattlesnake Rocks.A visit to the forest is an excellent opportunity to dive into nature as it receives fewer visitors compared to the areas nearby. There is a vast variety of recreation activities available, with something to engage in year-round. Forest guests can enjoy hundreds of miles of trails or take a drive on the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway; horseback riding, rafting, rock climbing, fishing, and camping are among the other activities that tempt people into visiting. Plentiful species of flora and fauna live in the Umpqua National Forest. 66 mammals, 18 fish, and 236 bird types inhabit the area, including elk, deer, fox, bats, winter steelhead, eagles, osprey, and peregrine falcons. As for the vegetation, old-growth forests consist of ponderosa pine, oaks, and Douglas fir, to name just a few. Numerous geological processes \u2014 such as massive volcanic activity, the High Cascades glaciation, and whitewater rapids \u2014 shaped the stunning terrain and landscape of the Umpqua National Forest, including the abundant waterfalls. The fact that the Umpqua National Forest unites several distinct geologic provinces resulted in such an interesting array of natural events. Andesite monolithic spires and volcanic basalt are typical of the forest and are among its most striking geologic features. As for Forest's historical background, over 10,000 years ago, the first people to inhabit the land were the ancestors of the Umpqua, Yoncalla, Southern Molala Tribes, and Cow Creek Band. After European and American settlers moved to the area, disease and violence, including the Rogue River Wars, greatly reduced the tribes\u2019 populations. Eventually, they were forcibly moved to Siletz and Grand Ronde Reservations. The Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua currently remains within the upper Umpqua Basin and is working towards restoring their ancestral homeland - learn more about the band on their website. In 1925, the United States Congress signed into law a bill that designated the Umpqua National Forest. At that time, logging and mining activities had been taking place before the area was protected and the Civilian Conservation Corps started to build bridges, roads, and recreation facilities."}]}

General Sherman occupies the top position, being the world's largest tree, as it measures 275 feet tall and has a base diameter of 36 feet. Mount Whitney (the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States!) is another outstanding landmark of the area. The bulk of the Park\u2019s territory is taken up by a Wilderness Area, offering an amazing journey across the forested mountainous terrain. Astounding biodiversity is revealed through the chain of elevational zones, each presenting a unique ecosystem. A number of lakes, rivers, and streams punctuate this extremely beautiful section of California wildland and abound with brook and golden trout, attracting both bears and anglers. You will have a chance to explore the giant sequoias of Grant Grove and the Giant Forest, visit the Giant Forest Museum to introduce yourself to the Park\u2019s natural and human history, enjoy the breathtaking views at Mineral King Valley, and see the fragile beauty of water-sculpted formations inside Crystal Cave.Miles of hiking trails, led by the prominent Pacific Crest Trail, provide opportunities to feast your eyes on the fantastic scenery and enjoy an adventure experience. Significant elevation change creates an impressive diversity of plant and animal species. Vegetation zones starting in the foothills with oak woodlands and chaparral are followed by pine forests which eventually turn into alpine meadows as you move higher in the mountains. Pines of the montane and subalpine zones are represented by white fir, sugar, incense-cedar, red fir, ponderosa, whitebark, foxtail, and limber pines. Outstanding members of this community, giant sequoias win in terms of size but are outnumbered by the pine trees. Wildlife is distributed in a similar way, according to the zones. Typical mammals in the foothills are gray fox, bobcat, striped and spotted skunks, black bear, woodrat, pocket gopher, and white-footed mouse. There are plenty of birds and reptiles as well, including the California quail, scrub jay, lesser goldfinch, wrentit, acorn woodpecker, gopher snake, California kingsnake, striped racer, western whiptail lizard, and the California newt. Chickaree, gray and golden-mantled ground squirrels, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, and a variety of birds populate the montane forests and meadows. Marmot, pika, and white-tailed jackrabbit live in the subalpine and alpine areas. The topography of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks encompasses portions of two grand geological formations: the foothills of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada range. The terrain was shaped by Pleistocene glaciers and subduction along the North American\u2013Pacific Plate boundary that created peaks, canyons, domes, glacial lakes, and marble caves.High peaks in the east of the parks (from 12,000 to 14,000 feet) descend steeply to the elevations of 4,500 feet in the western part, thus creating an impressive contrast. Mount Whitney is probably the most famous peak in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon\u2019s collection and one of the tallest mountains in the US, at 14,500 feet of elevation. Mountains and canyons are mostly composed of granite, diorite, and monzonite which are 100 million years old igneous intrusive rocks. Yet, the Sierra Nevada Range is only 10 million years old and was formed when the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block tilted and uplifted under the influence of tectonic forces in the region of the Great Basin. The impact of the glaciers is evident through the U-shaped valleys of Cedar Grove, Paradise Valley, and Tehipite Valley. Tehipite Dome, the biggest granite dome in the Sierra Nevada, was also formed by glaciers. Although nothing is left of those ancient glaciers these days, it doesn\u2019t mean there are no glaciers in the parks: they are found on the highest peaks and they are surprisingly rather young (~1,000 years old). However, they are melting swiftly and it is very likely they will soon disappear because of rising temperatures. The area of the parks was originally populated by the Monache. They primarily occupied the vicinity of the Kaweah River (i.e., the Foothills region) but they also used the mountain passes as trade routes. European settlers brought with them diseases new to the Indigenous Peoples and as the result, their population shrank substantially in a short period of time. Another problem the Monache had to face was the loss of their lands as the settlers began actively using the natural resources of the area, the Giant Sequoia trees being one of them. In 1890, the Sequoia National Park was established in an attempt to preserve the land and protect the trees from logging. Kings Canyon National Park was designated in 1940 largely because of (and thanks to!) John Muir\u2019s activism. The two parks united in 1943 due to their closeness and similarities."}]}

Tree species in the forested areas of the Hoover Wilderness include hemlock, pine, aspen, and cottonwood, and bright carpets of wildflowers cover the intermittent meadows.The Wilderness is home to a variety of bird and mammal life, such as black bears, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, mule deer, Sierra Nevada red fox, red-tailed hawk, and sage-grouse. The lakes are teeming with brown, brook, golden, and rainbow trout. HistoryThe earliest residents of the land in and around what later became the Hoover Wilderness were the Ahwahnechee, who lived there for at least the last 8,000 years. The Sierra Miwok were also known to visit the area as part of their trading routes. In the late 1840\u2019s and 1850\u2019s, during the California Gold Rush, the large influx of Europeans resulted in the Indigenous Peoples being forced from their traditional dwellings. Almost one hundred years later, the Hoover Wilderness became officially protected as it acquired the status of \u2018Primitive Area\u2019 in 1931 and got its name from then-president - Herbert Hoover. In 1956 the area was designated a Wilderness Area and became federally protected. The territory of the Hoover Wilderness was enlarged significantly to its present size in 2009.GeologyThe Hoover Wilderness occupies a portion of the Sierra Nevada mountain range stretching from the Sonora Pass on the north to the Tioga Pass on the south. The beginning of the Sierra Nevada geological history is associated with the Triassic period and the formation of the region\u2019s earliest granite. During the \u2018Nevadan Orogeny\u2019 metamorphic rocks were formed. In the Cretaceous period, magma emerged from the subduction process when an oceanic plate started to dive under the North American plate, and as a result, the Sierra Nevada batholith arose. Then came the glacier-related erosion during the Ice Age, when the characteristic rounded domes were created and U-shaped canyons were carved throughout the mountains. The Sierra Nevada continues to rise and the process is accompanied by large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake that took place in 1872.

NPCNF is the combination of two national forests (Nez Perce National Forest and Clearwater National Forest) which were administratively combined in 2012. The forest consists of six ranger districts, each offering their own unique outdoor recreation and camping opportunities. NPCNF owes its diverse range of activities to its geography, biodiversity, rich history, and climate. Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest has a humid continental climate with warm summers. This climate makes hiking, camping and boating here especially enjoyable, as visitors will likely avoid extreme temperatures during the summer months. During the winter, however, there is plenty of snow and the temperatures remain below freezing, but this creates opportunities for winter recreation like snowmobiling and cross-country skiing.This climate also gives way to a wonderful diversity of plants and animals in the forest. In fact, these two and a half million acres of mountains and vast landscapes are also home to the southern end of the largest inland temperate rainforest in North America! Fir and Pine species generally dominate this forest though so do thousands of streams and multiple major rivers, making it one of the best places for rafting and fishing in the United States. Aside from its vast outdoor recreation opportunities, NPCNF has preserved thousands of historical and archaeological sites - from the Nimiipuu Nation who arrived 11,500 years ago to the arrival of European-Americans in the 1800\u2019s. Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forest is known for its great biodiversity, all of which you will have the opportunity to observe while visiting this national forest.A study by the World Wildlife Fund ranked the Forest\u2019s Clearwater Basin as one of the best habitats for large carnivores in the Rocky Mountains. In addition to mountain lions, wolves, and black bears \u2014 Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forest is also home to a great variety of threatened and endangered species. These include lynx and grizzly bears, which are rarely spotted.Parts of the Nez Perce Clearwater National Forest are also a temperate rainforest. As such, you can expect to see a wide variety of plants. Specifically, this rainforest is made up mostly of Grand and Subalpine fir trees, as well as Western Redcedar and Rocky Mountain Maple. When it comes to the sheer land area covered by these tree species, the Spruce, Douglas, and Grand firs take up the most space. See more information and research about the trees in Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest in the Forest Service\u2019s Forest Resources of the Clearwater National Forest report. More detailed information about the ecosystem here can be found on the Forest Service\u2019s Nez Perce Terrestrial Ecosystem page. Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is rich in natural and human history in large part due to the fact that humans have inhabited the lands that today make up this forest for over 10,000 years - the people of the Nimiipuu Tribe were the main inhabitants of these lands until just over 200 years ago when Lewis and Clark led an expedition across these land in 1805-1806. Today you can visit the Lewis and Clark Grove on Cedar Creek, which commemorates where the expedition team set up camp. In addition to explorers, this region became frequented by fur trappers such as John Work, who led a party of about fifty from Hudson Bay along the Lolo Trail in 1831. The party was caught in an unusually early snowstorm in October that year which covered the grass in up to six feet of snow, made travel difficult if not impossible, and resulted in the loss of some of his horses.Later came miners with the discovery of gold in Pierce, Idaho in 1860 and most of the major streams that run through Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest owe their English names to the miners from that time who named them. Most of the miners and gold prospectors arrived from California, already experienced in the business thanks to the gold rush in the 1840s that brought them to California in the first place.The 1870s saw clashes between Americans and native peoples, namely, some tribes of the Nimiipuu People (or Nez Perce as Lewis and Clark had called them). They fought under the leadership of Chief Joseph who had resisted efforts by American settlers to relocate them from their ancestral lands in Oregon to less populated areas in Idaho. This became known as the Nez Perce War, a war that was fought for some 1,200 miles while the tribe was under pursuit of General Oliver Howard. Finally cornered in northwest Montana, not far from the Canadian border, Chief Joseph surrendered under the condition that he and his people could return to the promised reservation in Idaho. Today the Nez Perce reservation is situated in western Idaho near the Oregon and Washington borders, and is immediately adjacent to present-day Clearwater National Forest, which was established in 1908. More than a century later in 2012, Clearwater National Forest was combined with Nez Perce National Forest, giving way to the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest we have today. Read more about the history and culture of this region from one of the Forest Service\u2019s Historical and Cultural Publications.Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is located in the Northern Rocky Mountains Rocky Mountain System, except for a few small sections which are located in the Columbia Plateau (See Map). As for natural history, the story of the region\u2019s geology is just as interesting but obviously goes back much further than human history. Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest rests upon a bedrock of partially metamorphosed, Precambrian rocks that are part of the Belt Supergroup - a layer of sedimentary rocks that are over a billion years old! During the Precambrian Era, sediments were deposited into a vast, yet shallow sea which covered most of western Montana and even parts of northern Idaho. This sea is known as the Belt Basin. The sediments cemented into sandstones, shales, and limestones, which over time, and under the forces of heat and pressure, metamorphosed into quartzite, the product of metamorphosed quartz sandstone, and argillite, which is basically a lithified mud.Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is part of the Rocky Mountains, a mountain range that was uplifted and folded along fault lines. These faults have not only played a role in the landscape\u2019s development, but have also played a role in determining the movement of water through streams and rivers here. These faults and the associated tectonic movement has significantly altered the layers of the aforementioned Belt rocks. In some areas of Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest, you can observe its highly weathered and crushed Basalt bedrock.Another final note worthy of mention is the role volcanoes have played in formation of this region\u2019s geography and landscape. Eruptions from volcanoes in Washington and Oregon, namely, Glacier Peak, Mount St. Helens, and Crater Lake have all contributed to the mineral-rich composition of this forest\u2019s soil, which lays atop the Basalt bedrock. These mineral deposits from volcanic eruptions have helped make this area so highly productive in terms of plant life and vegetation.

One of the largest wildernesses in the contiguous US, the Pasayten features numerous high North Cascades crags on its western side, while the eastern portion is noted for some of the few places in the US with arctic tundra grasslands. Though for most Washington State citizens, the area is too distant for a day hike, so the wilderness offers immense solitude, with 600 miles of trails, glorious alpine lakes, and unique scenery, all worth a visit. Among popular attractions are Horseshoe Basin, Cathedral Pass, Silver Lake, and Remmel Mountain, but there\u2019s no end to exploring this magnificent wilderness. How Jeff Layton (of The Seattle Times) described the magic of the Pasayten: \u201cOne of the more unusual places in Washington: part Ireland, part Austria, sprinkled with a little bit of Yosemite and a whole lot of Lord of the Rings\u201d - this is a place you don\u2019t want to miss. The area has rich wildlife and includes deer, moose, mountain goats, mountain lions, bighorn sheep, and the gray wolf. Besides, the Pasayten supports the largest population of lynx in the lower 48. No less diverse is the plant community: fir, cedar, and western hemlock dominate on the western slopes, while subalpine fir, pine, and larch forests make their home on the eastern portion of the wilderness. Magnificent wildflower displays astound, with yarrow, lupine, penstemon, and prairie fire blooming in the summer. The first nomadic tribes came to the Pasayten in approximately 6,500 BC for hunting and herding purposes. However, there are few marks left by humans until the nineteenth century when hunters and trappers began reducing the beaver and marten population, and prospectors were searching for gold near Canyon and Slate Creeks. Farmers densely settled the region during the twentieth century and grazed sheep and cattle in the fragile alpine meadows. Not so many years passed until grazing eventually was banned, especially as tourism started to boom here in the 1970\u2019s when the North Cascades Highway 20 was built. In 1968, the Pasayten Wilderness was established by Congress and added 200,000 acres to the Okanogan National Forest.Geologically, the Pasayten is part of the North Cascades which features some of the most rugged landscapes in the Cascade Range. The Cascade Mountains formation began millions of years ago in the late Eocene Epoch. When the North American Plate overrode the Pacific Plate, volcanic, igneous rock-forming events occurred. Around 50 million years ago, terranes, small pieces of the oceanic and continental lithosphere, formed, more specifically, the North Cascades. More than two million years ago, during the Pleistocene Era, repetitive advancing and retreating glacial activity washed out the region\u2019s topography and left deposits of rock debris, as well as U-shaped valleys and the only boreal hummocks in the continental U.S. The constant glaciation, uplifts, and faults formed the summits and valleys of the region as we see them now."}]}

Paiute and Washoe Tribes populated the eastern Sierra Nevada for at least ten thousand years. have populated the eastern Sierra Nevada for at least ten thousand years. And the first Europeans here were Spanish explorers and missionaries in the 1700s, but they had little impact on these lands. In the early 1800s, hunters and fur trappers came to the region, and by the mid-19th century, prospectors had completely conquered these pristine lands. Just after 1860, when Samuel Bishop, with his hired men, stepped into Sierra\u2019s eastern valley. Bishop occupied this region as if the Paiute, who were already here, didn\u2019t exist, and it left a significant mark. His cattle fed on the areas hyacinth and nutgrass, which the Paiute lived off. Paiute stocks were exhausted even before the devastating 1861\u201362 winter, which led them to starvation. The forest can tell thousands of such stories. Still to this day, terrific examples of Native American presence can be found in the Inyo, though they should never be touched. In terms of geology, the Inyo NF primarily sprawls within the eastern Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains. Among the natural forces that shaped the area are massive sedimentation and erosion, volcanism and seismic upheaval, both gradual and violent, and the slow power of glaciation. The Inyo National Forest was created in 1907 as the result of a proclamation by Theodore Roosevelt. Later on, Congress enlarged the forest and its wilderness areas several times to nearly 2 million acres of scenic lands."}]}

The Absaroka Mountain Range, where the wilderness is located, extends southeast from Livingston, Montana, and the Yellowstone River across more than 150 miles to Riverton, Wyoming. This long chain of peaks were formed as a result of the eruptive activity of a large volcanic field called the Absaroka Volcanic Province. The glaciers that covered the mountains 10,000-20,000 years ago were other sculptors of this terrain.The tallest mountain in the area is Trout Peak, which tops out over 12,000 ft above sea level.HistoryThe area's name originates from the Hidatsa Tribe\u2019s word for the Crow Tribe, Aps\u00e1alooke, who have inhabited the Absaroka Range for thousands of years. The territories of what is now the North Absaroka Wilderness are also home to many other Indigenous tribes, including the Northern Arapaho Tribe, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. Famous explorer John Colter is believed to be the first known American of European descent to enter the Absarokas.

Also, the Pacific Crest Trail brings thousands of hikers to the mountain's flanks. On a clear day, the heights provide continuous views of Portland and over the area\u2019s other mountains, gorgeous lakes, and hidden hot springs and waterfalls. One of them is stunning Ramona Falls - an approximately 120 ft tall waterfall located on the upper Sandy River, on the west side of Mount Hood. A shady Douglas fir forest covers much of the lower elevations. It hides more than a dozen waterfalls, and is supported by an understory of noble fir, salal, Oregon grape, ponderosa pine, western hemlock, rhododendron, and huckleberries. Meanwhile, the forest floor is carpeted in beargrass, evergreen huckleberry, purple lupine, and beard lichen.The forest is home to a wide variety of mammals endemic to the Pacific Northwest, including coyote, elk, opossum, mountain beaver, and black-tailed deer. Mountain lions and black bears also roam the area, but rarely do people encounter them. While passing rocky slopes at the tree line, listen for the chirps and whistles of marmots and pikas.Many birds breed within the forest boundaries: bald eagles, northern spotted owls, downy woodpeckers, and ravens, among others. Mount Hood National Forest took its name from Mount Hood, which in turn owes its name to a British naval officer, Alexander Arthur Hood. The first people to inhabit the area were Indigenous Tribes, who mostly lived along the Columbia River, its creeks, and Willamette Valley. The bands included the Kalapuyans, Molalas, Chinookan Clackamas, Shinookan Wascas, Northern Paiutes, and Sahaptins.Fascinating enough, Middle and Upper Chinookan bands had a trail system, which almost runs concurrently with the modern Pacific Crest Trail. The tribes referred to Mount Hood as a sacred place. The legend goes that the Great Spirit became angry with his sons who were fighting over a woman, and turned all three into well-known mountains: Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood. Originally Mount Hood was known as Wy'est, and the word still lives in the names of local streets, businesses, and buildings.The first Europeans who visited the area were British officers in 1792, who were followed by Lewis and Clark in 1805-06. The Mount Hood National Forest received its first official designation in 1892. The forest has a rich history of names. For one year, it was known as Bull Run Timberland Reserve, then the Cascade Range Forest Reserve. When the US Forest Service was formed, the area was renamed again and referred to as the Oregon National Forest. Finally, in 1924 the forest was named after its most famous mountain, as the Mount Hood National Forest. Many attempts were made to change its status to that of a National Park and forbid logging operations but without success. By the 1920\u2019s, the forest received more and more visitors and gained more popularity. As people living around the forest needed job opportunities, especially during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed and provided a lot of them. The newly employed would go on to help build campgrounds, trails, and the famous Timberline Lodge. The largest project by that time, the lodge was formally opened by FDR in 1937, and it was declared Oregon's tenth National Historic Landmark in 1977. For all the trivia buffs out there, it also appeared in the movie The Shining. Being constructed as a ski lodge, Timberline Lodge still retains its original purpose today.From the geologic point of view, it is Mount Hood itself, a stratovolcano, that can be considered as one of the most curious features of the forest. A part of the Cascade Range, it was formed by glacial and volcanic activities, and is currently home to eleven glaciers. It has erupted sporadically for 500,000 years, but for the last 200 years, it has been inactive except for a few minor eruptions. For more information on its geology, visit Oregon Encyclopedia."}]}

The O-W stretches about 180 miles from the Canadian border in the north to the Goat Rocks Wilderness in the south. The Cascade Crest makes up its western edge, while the Yakima River valley and the Columbia and Okanogan Rivers form the forest's eastern borders. Elevations here change from 1,000 to more than 9,000 feet above sea level, and precipitation varies wildly from the eastern lowlands to the western highlands. These factors, therefore, provide the area with diverse nature and species. This immense, pristine forest offers a wide range of recreational opportunities throughout the year with something suitable for every age and experience level: fishing, climbing, hiking, snowmobiling, cross-country and downhill skiing, horseback riding, and mountain biking, to name a few. Over a thousand trails fascinate plenty of hikers and backpackers annually: Red Top, Saddle Rock, and Dirty Face Peak are extremely popular as lookout destinations, while Minotaur Lake, Rachel Lake, and Colchuck Lake provide tranquil lake views. The forest also sprawls along 200 miles of one of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail's most scenic stretches. Alpine and subalpine regions, wetlands, lush forests, and riparian habitats provide a home to diverse wildlife: mule deer, coyotes, fox, flying squirrels, muskrats, and river otters. Areas above timberline are home to pikas and marmots, while mountain goats inhabit the higher elevations. The Methow River watershed is one of few places bringing together such endangered species as grizzly bears, gray wolves, and lynx. Even the wolverine, one of the most intangible rare species, slowly migrates from British Columbia, Canada. Birdwatching opportunities are great, too, with bald eagles, spotted, gray, and great horned owls, which one may see in spring and summer. Fall features an impressive migration of northern goshawks, sharp-shinned, and red-tail hawks. The first humans are estimated to have started settling in this area over 11,000 years ago. They are the ancient ancestors of the most recent Indigenous Tribes that lived in the area, including the Yakama, Sahaptin, and the 12 bands of the Colville Confederated Tribes. The Lewis and Clark expedition were the first Americans to encounter the tribes in 1805 and Canadian settlers followed shortly thereafter. A few decades later, thousands of new settlers, via the Oregon Trail, had arrived in the area. Due to mounting pressure on land and resources, the Indigenous Tribes started signing treaties to move their people onto reservations. Today, the Colville Reservation borders the forest to the northeast, and the Yakama Reservation is to the southeast.The Okanogan \u2013 Wenatchee National Forest has a lengthy bureaucratic history. Both forests were established in 1908, though the Okanogan National Forest was originally named the Chelan National Forest. That is, until 1911 when the Forest Service split off a piece of the Chelan NF to create the Okanogan National Forest. Nine years later, in 1920, they were rejoined as the Chelan National Forest. In 1955, the name was officially changed to the Okanogan National Forest after the Chelan Ranger District became part of the Wenatchee NF. Both the Okanogan and Wenatchee Forests remained distinct units until they were finally merged in 2000 - forming the largest National Forest in the Pacific Northwest."}]}

The Columbia River Gorge NSA is a stunning river canyon that sprawls along almost 300,000 acres through the Cascade Range. In a matter of just 80 miles, ecosystems range from temperate rainforests to dry grasslands - the transition makes its landscape so rich and diverse. Visitors will be treated to stunning panoramic views from the Angel\u2019s Rest Lookout, countless waterfalls, including Multnomah Falls (one of the most visited spots in the Pacific Northwest), and the Bridge of the Gods, an awe-inspiring bridge that takes you from Oregon to Washington. Numerous highlights and the area\u2019s proximity to Portland make it an extremely popular destination. It also features the first campground developed by the US Forest Service, the Eagle Creek Campground! It\u2019s not an overstatement to say that the NSA encompasses some of the most scenic landscapes in the United States. Recreation opportunities include hiking, camping, water activities, fishing, and biking - the majority are accessible via the Historic Columbia River Highway, a scenic road that boasts multiple gorgeous vistas. Twenty-six miles of the Pacific Crest Trail also meander through the NSA, along with over 30 other beautiful paths. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area truly has something to cater to all tastes!  The Columbia River Gorge NSA stuns with its variety of flora and fauna! The Scenic Area is home to 44 species of fish (including plenty of salmon!), over 200 bird species, numerous types of mammals, and over 800 species of plants! The Northern Spotted Owl, a threatened species, also inhabits the area. Common mammals include deer, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, and black bear. As for vegetation, the western part of the Gorge is characterized by Douglas fir, bigleaf maples, and western hemlock, while the eastern part features expansive grasslands with rare areas of ponderosa and lodgepole pines. Starting to take its shape over 40 million years ago, the Columbia River Gorge experienced its most significant changes at the end of the last Ice Age. A series of massive glacial lake outbursts, known as the Missoula Floods, cut the deep and steep walls that we see today. The last outbursts actually flooded the river up to the Crown Point, which today is 733 ft. above the river. As the erosion was swift, numerous layers of volcanic rock were exposed. For more information on the geology of the Columbia River Gorge, check out gorgeconnection.org or The Evolving Landscape of the Columbia River Gorge. As for the area\u2019s human history, people have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Celilo Falls was the main fishing and trading area for local Indigenous Tribes. Also, the Columbia River Gorge was an important transportation corridor. When Europeans started to take an interest in the area and subsequently immigrate there, the Tribes suffered from new epidemics and violence. For more information on the development of the area, please visit the History and Culture page of the US Forest Service. The Columbia River Gorge was the second ever area to be established as a U.S. National Scenic Area. It was designated by the US Congress and President Reagan in 1986. Another more recent event that is worth mentioning is the Eagle Creek Fire. The fire burned for three months in the fall of 2017 and heavily restricted access to certain portions of the NSA. Since then the area has mostly been restored. "}]}

Just 70 miles from Washington, D.C., Shenandoah is a place where one can retreat from the bustle of urban life, reconnect with nature, and find healing, calm, and harmony.Famous for its scenery, Shenandoah National Park boasts some of the most breathtaking panoramic views in the eastern US. Lots of visitors enjoy these views from their cars driving along Skyline Drive. The road runs 105 miles along the Blue Ridge Crest and offers spectacular vistas of surrounding valleys, plenty of opportunities to spot wildlife, and, if you\u2019re lucky, the chance to spot the Washington Monument in D.C.!. The park features great opportunities for hiking and backpacking, too. More than five hundred miles of trails, including a 101-mile section of the Appalachian Trail, cover the area and offer excellent exposure to the beautiful natural landscape of the Blue Ridge Mountains. There are plenty of attractions that you can find in Shenandoah. Gorgeous waterfalls, lush forests, spectacular viewpoints, scenic rock formations, wildflower meadows, and historical sites can\u2019t wait to be explored. You can climb Old Rag Mountain, stargaze in Big Meadows, take pictures of Dark Hollow Falls, go back in time at Rapidan Camp - all visitors can find something to their liking in Shenandoah! By the beginning of the 20th century, dozens of native animal species had disappeared after two centuries of human activity in this area. Thanks to the protection of the area, the situation has improved a lot, and Shenandoah features a great variety of wildlife. Keep your eyes open for white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, rabbits, and foxes. Black bears and coyotes roam this area as well, though park visitors rarely encounter them. Birdwatching is another great option in the park, which provides habitat for more than 190 species of birds. Be on the lookout for wild turkey, barred owl, red-tailed hawk, great blue heron, and Carolina chickadee. Shenandoah National Park is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains, which is a part of the larger Appalachian Mountain Range. The Blue Ridge Mountains were formed about 320 million years ago, and at that time, they were among the highest mountains in the world. After millions of years of erosion, the mountains that used to be as high as the Alps have been worn down. Indigenous Peoples first came to Shenandoah about 8,000 to 9,000 years ago to hunt and gather food. The first Europeans arrived in the 18th century and started to settle down near the streams and springs. By the 1920\u2019s, a big part of the park\u2019s area had been deforested and overused, and it took years to restore it.The park was established in 1935 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt."}]}

It encompasses 63,960 acres of land jointly managed by the Eldorado National Forest and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU).The Desolation Wilderness is noted for its breathtaking alpine scenery, granite outcrops, glacial lakes, and valleys. Hikers and horseback riders are welcome to explore the area through miles of fantastic trails including sections of the Pacific Crest and Tahoe Rim Trails. Mule deer and black bear are frequently seen in this area. Coyote, porcupine, badger, and bobcat are rather common but also elusive, so there is less of a chance to spot them. Fisher, pine marten, red fox, and wolverine roam the Wilderness, too, but they are really rare and park officials encourage visitors to report sightings which will help to learn more about their abundance. Desolation\u2019s rodents are represented by yellow-bellied marmot, golden-mantled ground squirrel, Douglas squirrel, and pika. As for the area\u2019s birds, they include the Steller's Jay, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee, blue grouse, mountain, bluebird, American dipper, golden eagle, and others. Rainbow, brook, brown, and golden trout species make homes in the local lakes and streams.The Desolation Wilderness contains a wide range of ecosystems associated with the range of elevations and soil types. The area's red fir and lodgepole forests are mainly made up of Jeffrey pine, mountain hemlock, western juniper, and western white pine. The wooded areas are mostly clustered within elevations between 7,400 feet and 9,000 feet and become patchy as you climb higher. Another group of plants found in the Wilderness is montane chaparral that includes pinemat manzanita, huckleberry oak, and mountain pride penstemon. The ground surface is mainly composed of bedrock granite and fertile soils are limited to the wet meadows scattered throughout the Wilderness, as well as the lands surrounding lakes and streams. Aspen and willow trees are common there and numerous wildflowers, sedges, and grasses blanket these areas. GeologyAs the territory of the Wilderness covers a portion of the Sierra Nevada, the geology of the Desolation Wilderness is closely related to the Sierra Nevada geological history. Composed of igneous rock, the Sierra Batholith forms the bedrock of the range. About 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period, the Nevadan orogeny took place, when the Sierra Batholith was uplifted, thus creating the mountains. However, those mountains have not \u2018survived\u2019 to our time because of the erosion during the Pleistocene glaciation. The glaciers that covered the region back then sculpted the shape of the mountains that we can see today and carved the roche moutonn\u00e9es, erratics, and countless basins that define the local terrain. Hundreds of lakes formed within these basins, e.g., Emerald Bay, Cascade Lake, Fallen Leaf Lake, and Echo Lakes.HistoryThe Desolation Wilderness preserves some historic artifacts proving that the Washoe used to build temporary camps in several areas here, including Wrights Lake. They stayed at those camps during their regular summer migrations to the Sierra Nevada. The rest of the year they spent time partially in the ranges to the east and partially in the valleys in-between.In the beginning of the 19th century, Europeans started to explore the area. Miners came here in search of gold but didn\u2019t find much. Between the 1850\u2019s and 1950\u2019s sections of the Wilderness were used for grazing and several dams were constructed.The area has been officially protected since 1899 but acquired the Wilderness Area status and its present name only in 1969 after a series of reorganizations."}]}

Before that, between 1906 and 1926, the forest was damaged by loggers. They cut down the majority of spruce trees over 10 ft. tall or with a diameter of more than 4 ft. Then, destructive fires of 1925 and 1942 became another reason for Shining Rock's grassy \"balds\". All these misfortunes gave way to some new unique vegetation, though. Area elevations start at 3,300 ft and reach over 6,000 feet on three mountain peaks, with Cold Mountain (6,030 ft) being the highest of them.The wilderness' steep and rugged terrain occupies the northern Pisgah Ledge slope, an eastern extension of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The mountains here form a big \u201cU\u201d shaped valley and their western half (the mountains form a big \"U\" shape) is located in Middle Prong Wilderness, Shining Rock's closest neighbor. Shining Rock Wilderness was named after the micaceous white quartz outcroppings that can be found near the Shining Rock Mountain crest. The Shining Rock Ledge (sometimes it is also called a ridge) is the area's backbone. Several high ridges extend east and west from the ledge, offering excellent hiking and backpacking opportunities. Beautiful white quartz outcroppings helped name Shining Rock Wilderness, the largest Wilderness in North Carolina. From 3,300 ft. on the banks of the West Fork of Pigeon River, a series of high and steep ridges rises up to Cold Mountain which tops out at 6,030 ft.Various cascading streams cut narrow passages through the forested mountains, winding their way to the East and West Pigeon River Forks. Here, high-elevation trails offer breathtaking, long-distance views over surrounding lands. This place is home to many waterfalls, whitewater rivers and pools, heavily forested slopes, and miles of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails. Shining Rock Wilderness boasts dozens of recreational opportunities, which makes the area a truly unique experience in the Southern Appalachians. Shining Rock Wilderness is covered with dense forests of different types. Northern hardwoods (maple, yellow birch, and beech), cove hardwoods (buckeye, basswood, sourwood, tulip poplar, and maple), and upland hardwoods (oaks, ash, and hickory), are typical for the lower elevations. At higher elevations, the vegetation mostly consist of spruce-fir trees, heath, and grassy balds. The wilderness is also home to various unusual plants for this area, such as orchids, ferns, and mosses. There are many blueberries hiding in the bushes, which attract not only hikers but black bears. Respect and be on the lookout for wildlife."}]}

Common tree species include mountain hemlock, lodgepole, ponderosa, and whitebark pines. Beargrass, huckleberry, and rhododendron also blanket certain areas.Deer, elk, pika, marmot, marten, snowshoe hare, and ground squirrel make their homes in the Wilderness. American black bears and cougars also roam the area but sightings are rare. Local lakes hold populations of brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow trout, and frogs are often spotted around them. As for geology, Mount Washington is a 7,795-foot volcano with a pinnacle shape that often gets compared to its Cascade cousin to the south, Mount Thielsen. Apart from Mount Thielsen, this summit shape also unites Mount Washington with Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. This group has an informal name, 'Oregon's Matterhorns,' as a result of their similarity to the famed Swiss peak. All the volcanoes in the group stopped erupting at least 100,000 to 250,000 years ago, resulting in drastic reshaping by glaciers throughout time. Extensive glaciation during the late Pleistocene is evident in the cirques and U-shaped canyons carved into the slopes of the volcano, outwash plains, as well as lateral, recessional, and terminal ground moraines.HistoryIn 1872, a wagon road was created across McKenzie Pass. Six decades later, the road was paved and became Oregon Route 242. It owes its name to the neighboring McKenzie River. Donald McKenzie, after whom the river was named, was a fur trader who explored the region in 1812. Today, the pass and Route 242 make up the southern border of the Mount Washington Wilderness. Another fun fact from the history of the Wilderness - the first to climb Mount Washington were six boys from the nearby town of Bend in 1923.The Mount Washington Wilderness was officially established in 1964. Nestled in the central Cascades, the Mount Washington Wilderness encompasses 54,278 acres on and around the area\u2019s eponymous volcano. It spans parts of the Willamette and Deschutes National Forests and is jointly managed by them.While the spire-like summit of Mount Washington is definitely a huge draw in the wilderness, its other prominent features include the Belknap Crater shield volcano, numerous magnificent lakes, and the Dee Wright Observatory, next to its southern boundary.The Pacific Crest Trail is the major, and most popular, route in the area. The section through the Mount Washington Wilderness offers a challenging hike with few sources of water. Less popular, yet still amazing, trails are the rather easy and enjoyable Patjens Lakes Trail, Hand Lake Trail, and Benson Lake Trail.Please note: Currently there are no maintained trails on the East side of the Mount Washington Wilderness. Specifically, the Dry Creek Trail has not been maintained since the 2011 Shadow Lake Fire, is impossible to find in places, and has many trees that have been blown down across the trail. While the eastside area is still accessible, it is a true bushwacking, wilderness experience not to be taken lightly - map and compass skills are required (and probably a GPS too!)"}]}
