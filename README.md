# API-Data-Transformation-and-Langchain
This project is a collection of scripts to create content about hiking. For Area Descriptions, I use Langchain to extract key information from web sources and an LLM to generate text based on the gathered data. For POIs, I use public data API and various scripts to transform and reassemble the data pieces into an original (albeit standardized) text
api_pois contains functions, both for LLM-driven transformations, regular string manipulations and other small tasks.
